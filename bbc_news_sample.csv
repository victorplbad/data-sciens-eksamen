https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d8n140mpjo,Romanian far-right presidential hopeful barred from poll rerun,"Romanian far-right populist Calin Georgescu has been barred from participating in May's presidential election rerun by the country's Central Electoral Bureau (BEC), triggering clashes between his supporters and police. Last year, Romania's constitutional court annulled November's first round of the vote - in which he came first - after intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The BEC rejected his candidacy on Sunday, saying it ""doesn't meet the conditions of legality"", as he ""violated the very obligation to defend democracy"". Georgescu called that decision a ""direct blow"" to democracy. He now has 24 hours from Sunday's verdict to submit an official appeal to the top court, which should issue a ruling within 72 hours. In a social media post, Georgescu called the ban a ""direct blow to the heart of democracy worldwide"". Tear gas was fired at supporters of the presidential hopeful as violence broke out between them and police while they gathered in their thousands outside the offices of the BEC in the capital Bucharest. The BBC saw at least one car turned over, and the windows of neighbouring bars smashed. At least four people were detained. While many protesters left the scene, several hundred people remained and continued to fight with riot police, who brought in reinforcements and attempted to cordon off the area. On 26 February, Georgescu was arrested on his way to register as a candidate in the summer election, prompting tens of thousands of Romanians to march on Bucharest's streets in protest. He was charged with attempting to overthrow constitutional order and membership of a neo-fascist organisation. He has denied all wrongdoing. The 62-year-old independent came from nowhere to win the first round of last year's election, the results of which were annulled just days before the second round of voting. One key to his sudden popularity was his promise to ""restore Romania's dignity"" and end subservience to the international organisations it belongs to, including Nato and the EU. Before last year's annulment, the pro-Russian politician told the BBC he would end all support for Ukraine if he was elected. Georgescu has also seen some support from the Trump administration. Last month, US Vice-President JD Vance accused Romania of annulling the elections based on the ""flimsy suspicions"" of Romanian intelligence and pressure from its neighbours. Meanwhile, Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu accused Elon Musk of a ""form of interference"" in Romania's elections, after the billionaire posted several messages of support for Georgescu.",2025-03-09T23:35:29.203Z,Nick Thorpe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9dp5rr2x9o,US says Ukraine 'ready to move forward' on truce demand,"The Trump administration believes Ukraine's leadership is ""ready to move forward"" with the US's demand for a ceasefire process with Russia, according to a senior US state department official. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz are due to arrive in Saudi Arabia for Tuesday's talks with their Ukrainian counterparts. US President Donald Trump has stepped up pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to accept his demands for a quick ceasefire with Moscow - but without any immediate pledge of a US security guarantee. Ten days ago the two publicly clashed at the White House, with Trump claiming Zelensky was not ready to end the fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. ""The fact that they're coming here at senior levels is a good indication to us that they want to sit down and they're ready to move forward,"" said the state department official, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the talks with Ukraine in Jeddah. While Zelensky is also due in the Gulf kingdom to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the former is not expected to play any formal role in the talks with the Americans. The Ukrainian team will be represented by Zelensky's head of office Andriy Yermak, the country's national security adviser as well as foreign and defence ministers. Zelensky wrote on social media on Monday that Ukraine ""has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason that the war is continuing is because of Russia"". A short while later, during a daily briefing, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that it was important to determine whether Ukraine really wanted peace or not. Zelensky has on numerous occasions been accused by US officials of not wanting peace. The Ukrainian leader has been under strong US pressure to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, while he has been pushing for firm security guarantees for Kyiv, stressing that Putin violated previous ceasefire deals. On Friday, Trump issued a rare threat of further sanctions against Moscow in a push for a deal. Russia is already heavily sanctioned by the US over the war. Trump said he was contemplating the move because ""Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now"". Soon after the White House row, Zelensky expressed regret about the incident and tried to repair relations with the US - the country's biggest military supplier. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, later said that Trump had received a letter from Zelensky that included an ""apology"" and ""sense of gratitude"". Witkoff said that in Saudi Arabia the US team wanted to discuss a ""framework"" for peace to try to end the Russia-Ukraine war. A major minerals deal - derailed because of the row - is also reported to be back on the agenda in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine has offered to grant the US access to its rare earth mineral reserves in exchange for US security guarantees. Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko said he believed Zelensky needed to secure the US-Ukraine relationship ""at any cost"" during his trip to Saudi Arabia, while making clear ""what our red lines are"". ""Otherwise, if there is a deal outside of these terms, then we will just say no, that's all. Because it's our army fighting,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The clash at the White House also resulted in the US pausing all military aid to Ukraine and stopping sharing intelligence. But when asked on Sunday whether he would consider lifting the intelligence pause, Trump answered: ""Well, we just about have. I mean, we really just about have and we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done."" He provided no further details. On 18 February - before the US-Ukraine row in Washington - Rubio held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia. It was a follow-up to Trump's controversial phone conversation with Putin. The comments come as the Ukrainian military said that it shot down 130 Russian drones overnight. Over the weekend, a wave of Russian drone strikes killed at least 25 people - mainly in the eastern Donetsk town of Dobropillya. Elsewhere, Russian forces are reportedly trying to encircle thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region after recapturing three settlements on Sunday. It comes seven months after a cross-border assault that Kyiv launched in part to gain a bargaining chip in possible peace negotiations. Reports from Russian bloggers say Moscow special forces had crept for miles through a gas pipeline near the town of Sudzha in an attempt to surprise Ukrainian forces. Also on Monday, the Ukraine's Ministry of Defence said it will purchase 4.5 million Ukrainian-made drones in 2025, at a cost of more than £2bn.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w195pgp40o,Whippet called Miuccia wins best in show at Crufts,"A whippet from Venice in Italy has been named best in show at the 2025 Crufts dog show in Birmingham. Four-year-old Miuccia beat more than 18,000 dogs from around the world to claim the top award on Sunday at the NEC. ""It's really a dream come true,"" said her handler Giovanni Liguori. ""I am truly overwhelmed. Miuccia performed her best"". It is the first time a dog from Italy has won best in show, which comes with a trophy and small cash prize of reportedly £200. Miuccia, who is owned by Enrico De Gaspari, was the winner of the hound group earlier in the show, and beat the winners of six other groups to win the top prize. ""I absolutely adore her,"" said handler Mr Liguori. ""She is the sweetest dog. ""She always wants to be super close to me and that's the most important thing."" Mr Liguori said it was ""incredible, it's amazing"" to be the first dog from Italy to be crowned best in show. ""As Italians we are super proud and means that we are doing a fantastic job."" Helen Kerfoot, Crufts show manager, said it was ""fantastic"" to watch Miuccia and her handler's ""strong relationship together in the ring, and they are truly deserving winners"". ""Well done to all of our other wonderful finalists too. ""The dogs, their owners, and handlers should be incredibly proud to have taken part in such a momentous final - it's an incredible achievement, one we are sure they'll treasure for years to come."" The runner-up was Viking, a Tibetan mastiff from Romania.",2025-03-10T03:54:15.543Z,N/A
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4lj15lyv3o,"Russian strikes kill at least 25, Ukraine says","At least 25 people have died in Ukraine in the latest wave of Russian strikes, Ukrainian officials say, as the conflict shows no sign of easing. One attack on Donetsk Region killed at least 11 people and wounded 40, including six children, local officials said on Saturday. Homes and infrastructure were hit in other regions, including Kharkiv and Odesa. Russian attacks have intensified in recent days, as the US paused military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. It followed last week's Oval Office clash between President Donald Trump and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky. After the latest Russian strikes, Polish PM Donald Tusk said: ""This is what happens when someone appeases barbarians."" ""More bombs, more aggression, more victims,"" he added in a social media post. The deadliest strikes occurred late on Friday in the Donetsk Region town of Dobropillya. At least 11 people were killed when two ballistic missiles hit eight residential buildings and a shopping centre, officials said. After emergency services arrived, Russia launched another strike ""deliberately targeting the rescuers"", Zelensky said in a Telegram post. ""Such strikes show that Russia's goals are unchanged,"" he added.  Other attacks in the region killed nine people and wounded 13 on Friday and Saturday, local officials said. Drones struck a company in Bohodukhiv, Kharkiv Region, killing three people and injuring seven early on Saturday, regional head Oleh Synyehubov reported. Another drone attack on Friday hit civilian and energy infrastructure in Odesa, the regional head said. ""This is the seventh attack on the region's energy system in three weeks,"" the DTEK energy company said. Meanwhile Ukraine has continued to target Russia, whose defence ministry said its forces had intercepted 31 Ukrainian drones overnight. On Friday, Trump said he was finding it ""more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine"" than Russia in attempts to broker peace between the two nations. The US is ""doing very well with Russia"", and ""it may be easier dealing with"" Moscow than Kyiv, he told reporters. Hours earlier, Trump had said he was ""strongly considering"" large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire with Ukraine was reached. In addition to halting military and intelligence help, the US suspended Ukraine's access to some satellite imagery, space technology company Maxar said on Friday. The move came exactly a week after the extraordinary exchange at the White House, in which Trump berated Zelensky for being ""disrespectful"" to the US. The Trump administration's overtures to Putin have left many in Europe concerned that the continent will not be able to rely on US support for its security. On Thursday EU leaders met in Brussels to approve plans to spend more on defence and renew the bloc's support for Ukraine. Next week Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is due to hold talks with Ukrainian negotiators in Saudi Arabia to discuss the possibility of a ceasefire with Russia. Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, and now controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.",2025-03-08T17:00:19.948Z,Henri Astier
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw27gnjjjyo,Pope Francis thanks medical staff for 'tender' care,"Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia and bronchitis for more than three weeks, has thanked the medical staff looking after him for their ""tender"" care. For the fourth consecutive Sunday, the Argentine Pontiff was not present for his weekly blessing, but the Vatican shared the text he had prepared. ""While I am here, I think of the many people who are.. close to the sick,"" he said, describing them as ""bringing a little light into the night of pain"". The Vatican said on Saturday the Pope had shown a ""good response"" in recent days to his treatment at Rome's Gemelli hospital. ""The clinical condition of the Holy Father in recent days has remained stable and, consequently, indicates a good response to the treatment,"" the Vatican said. ""There is therefore a gradual, slight improvement"", it added. In his blessing, Francis wrote that he had experienced ""thoughtfulness of service and the tenderness of care, in particular from the doctors and health care workers, whom I thank from the bottom of my heart"". ""I think of the many people who in various ways are close to the sick, and who are for them a sign of the Lord's presence. ""We need this, the 'miracle of tenderness' which accompanies those who are in adversity, bringing a little light into the night of pain."" On Sunday evening, the Vatican said the Pope had joined what were described as ""spiritual exercises"" for senior Catholic clerics via video link, although the Pope himself was not visible. The exercises, an annual period of spiritual reflection, were led by a preacher, as usual. The Pope joined as a ""recipient"", the Vatican said. On Saturday morning the 88-year-old prayed in the chapel of the papal suite at Gemelli Hospital, the Vatican said. The Pope has not been seen in public since entering the hospital on 14 February, his longest stretch away from the public eye since his papacy began 12 years ago. He was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties - and first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. He is particularly vulnerable to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. The Pope's doctors believe he is likely to face a long road to recovery, due to his age and medical history.",2025-03-09T19:14:14.107Z,Sarah Rainsford
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87vg38dnpo,Musk and Rubio spar with Polish minister over Starlink in Ukraine,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk have clashed with Poland's foreign minister over the use of the tech billionaire's Starlink satellite internet system in Ukraine. Musk said on X that Ukraine's ""entire front line"" would collapse if he turned the system off. Radoslaw Sikorski responded, saying his country paid for its use in Ukraine and a threat to shut it down would result in a search for another network. Rubio dismissed Sikorski's claims and told him to be grateful, while Musk called him a ""small man"". The exchange appeared to lead to Polish PM Donald Tusk calling on his country's allies to show respect for their weaker partners, rather than arrogance. Starlink's system is part of SpaceX's venture to provide high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas. It has been used extensively by the Ukrainian military. Sunday's exchange started when Musk posted that Starlink was the ""backbone of the Ukrainian army"" and that ""their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off"". Sikorski then responded, saying that Poland was paying for the service. ""Starlinks for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year,"" Sikorski wrote. ""The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers."" In response, Rubio said Sikorski was ""just making things up... no-one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink"". ""And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,"" he added. Musk later responded to Sikorski's post calling him a ""small man"". ""Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink,"" he wrote. On Monday morning Polish Prime Minister Tusk, without specifying who or what he was referring to, wrote on X: ""True leadership means respect for partners and allies. ""Even for the smaller and weaker ones. Never arrogance. Dear friends, think about it."" The Starlink terminals are key to Ukraine's army operations and have been used since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022. There are tens of thousands of terminals in the country, including up to 500 bought by the US Department of Defence in June 2023. Starlink provides internet connection enabling Ukrainian troops to observe what's happening on the frontline. Each military unit has a base where they receive a video stream from reconnaissance drones. Monitoring the battleground in real time compensates for the shortage of troops. The Ukrainian Army does not need to keep large forces along the entire area they defend because they will know when Russian troops launch an attack and can quickly react by striking that area with artillery and other weapons. Video streams from drones also help to direct artillery fire and identify targets for kamikaze drones. They are the eyes of the Ukrainian troops, without which their lack of weapons and ammunition in would have catastrophic consequences. Starlink provides one of, if not the most, reliable means of communication. Without it requesting evacuation or providing the exact location of a target would be much slower and more complicated as regular radio stations may be out of range, jammed or compromised.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62k0kxwzywo,Russian spy ring's plans to kill journalist 'beyond imagination',"A journalist targeted by a Russian spy ring said it had a list of ""assassination methods"" to kill him that was ""beyond any imagination"". Christo Grozev told the BBC the group ""fantasised"" about his death, and talked about using a sledgehammer and even a ""suicide bomber"" to target him. The Bulgarian, who has published several exposés on Russia with colleague Roman Dobrokhotov, said several incidents showed the pair were tracked across Europe and had agents ""breathing down our necks"". He was speaking after three Bulgarian nationals were found guilty last week of spying for Russia one of the largest foreign intelligence operations in the UK. Mr Grozev said that since the court case, Austrian police had reassured his children that this not could not happen again, adding that initially his family had been ""shocked"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, he said the ""list of imagined assassination methods"" on his life ""reads like a film noir"". He said one of the ways the spies ""fantasised about killing me"" was hiring an Islamic State group ""suicide bomber and having him explode himself next to me in the street"". Mr Grozev said there was also a plan to kidnap him and ""send me to a torture camp in Syria"" while another man wearing a latex mask resembling him would fly to Russia on a commercial flight and be ""arrested in front of cameras for full deniability"". ""Another way was bludgeoning me to death using a sledgehammer"", he said before adding that ""the fantasy and imagination of these wannabe spies is beyond any imagination"". Mr Grozev said failures of Russian intelligence in the past meant that spying was being ""outsourced"" to non-professional spies. He told the BBC that the fact they were using ""non-professional"" spies did not take away from the ""intent to kill"". The issue was that ""wannabe spies"" did not necessarily know how to de-escalate situations, he added. He said he felt lucky to be alive given that he and his colleague were tracked by the spies for so long and the operation had been so well-funded. He and Mr Dobrokhotov were never on the lookout for EU citizens spying on them, but they had expected that Russian operatives would be observing them, he added. The pair's work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on then-Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. Jan Marsalek, who instructed the spy ring on behalf of the Russian intelligence services, wrote in a message in December 2020 that Mr Grozev was the ""lead investigator in the Navalny case"". A message sent by Marsalek to Orlin Roussev - who ran the UK-based group from a former guest house in Norfolk - said: ""Personally I find Grozev not to be a very valuable target but apparently Putin seriously hates him."" After 2020, the spy cell followed the two journalists throughout Europe, spying on them on planes, in hotels and private properties. On Friday, three spies were found guilty of spying for Russia in one of the largest"" foreign intelligence operations in the UK. In court, it came to light that operatives from the spy ring entered Grozev's flat in Vienna in 2022 ""when my son was playing a computer game in his room"", the journalist said. He added: ""I just don't want to think about what would've happened if my son decided to go out of his room during their burglary."" On Friday, Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were found guilty of conspiracy to spy. While the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps. The methods they used were the sort of thing you would ""expect to see in a spy novel"", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy.",2025-03-09T20:04:59.300Z,Hollie Cole

Hours earlier, Trump had said he was ""strongly considering"" large-scale sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a ceasefire with Ukraine was reached. Meanwhile, the US has temporarily suspended Ukraine's access to some satellite imagery, space technology company Maxar told BBC Verify, after Trump had already paused military aid to the country. It comes exactly one week after an extraordinary White House exchange, in which Trump berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for being ""disrespectful"" to the US. That public dressing-down was followed this week by Trump pausing all US military aid and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv. Russia then conducted a large-scale missile and drone attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Thursday night.  Follow live: Russian strikes kill at least 14, Ukraine says  Trump's threat of further sanctions on the already heavily sanctioned Russia was apparently in response to this attack. He said he was considering new tariffs because ""Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now"". But within hours, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin was acting as anyone else would. ""I think he's hitting them [Ukraine] harder than he's been hitting them,"" Trump said. ""And I think probably anyone in that position would be doing that right now."" He added that he believes Putin wants to end the war but he cannot say the same of Ukraine. ""I want to know they [Ukraine] want to settle and I don't know they want to settle,"" Trump said, when asked why he had cut off aid to Kyiv. Trump's direct diplomacy with Putin stunned Nato allies, because the West has shunned contacts with Moscow since Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Despite Trump's row with Zelensky, the tone from his foreign policy team in the last two days has sounded more conciliatory towards Ukraine, after its arm-wrenching in the form of cutting off military and intelligence support. The Americans want Zelensky to sign a deal that would give them a major stake in Ukrainian minerals, and for him to agree to a quick truce with Moscow. Zelensky has been pushing for firm security guarantees for Kyiv, to be agreed as part of the deal. Speaking on Friday, Trump said such a security guarantee could be discussed later and would be the ""easy part"". Meanwhile, space technology company Maxar told BBC Verify on Friday that the US had temporarily suspended Ukrainian access to some high quality imagery from US satellites. Satellite imagery is an important tool during a war as it allows armies to gather intelligence on their rivals. Maxar, a US-based company, has contracts to provide satellite imagery to various governments and companies. One of those is the Global Enhanced GEOINT Deliver (GEGD) program, which gives users access to high quality imagery collected by the US government. ""The US government has decided to temporarily suspend Ukrainian accounts in GEGD,"" Maxar told the BBC. ""Each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data."" The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, part of the US Department of Defense, confirmed the suspension was ""in accordance with the administration's directive on support to Ukraine"". Next week, Trump's senior officials will travel to Saudi Arabia to meet Zelensky's team amid growing pressure for him to sign up to Trump's demands. Ukraine's president has said he hopes the talks will be ""meaningful"". On Friday, he said his country was ""ready for peace as soon as possible"" and had proposed ""concrete steps"" to achieve it. ""Every day, new Russian strikes and reality itself prove that it is Russia that must be forced to peace,"" he added. Zelensky has expressed regret in the days since his public clash with Trump and worked to mend relations with the US. On Thursday, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said Trump had received a letter from Zelensky that included an ""apology"" and ""sense of gratitude"". ""Hopefully, we get things back on track with the Ukrainians, and everything resumes,"" Witkoff said. UK officials have said around 20 countries are interested in joining a ""coalition of the willing"" to help Ukraine, as European leaders forge ahead with plans for much bigger military expenditure. Fighting on the ground in Ukraine continued on Friday, with five people killed by Russian troops in the Donetsk region, according to local authorities.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjd78jpqj9o,Ukrainian family reunited after visa changes reversed,"In January visa changes which prevented Ukrainians from bringing their children to join them in the UK were reversed, giving hundreds of families hope they could finally be reunited. Ivan Vitsyn and his wife Olesia Aladko had been preparing for months for their children to join them in the UK. The family are from the Kharkiv region of eastern Ukraine, close to the Russian border, and had left their seven-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter with Ivan's parents while they found a suitable home for them to live. The parents - who came to the UK in May 2023 as strawberry pickers on seasonal worker visas - had planned to act as sponsors for their children under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people in the UK to host those fleeing the war. Originally living in a caravan, it was several months before they found a family home to rent. But in February last year - without warning - the previous Conservative government changed eligibility rules so only British or Irish citizens or those with the right to live in the UK permanently could act as sponsors. ""We worked so hard to prepare to reunite with the kids and then overnight we were not able to,"" says Ivan, speaking through a translator. ""The dream was shattered to pieces, we didn't know what to do."" Meanwhile, their children were stuck in Ukraine, living alongside the sounds of explosions, just 50km (31 miles) from the battlefield. The pair tried desperately without success to find a British sponsor for their children. Instead they were faced with scammers asking for thousands of pounds in exchange for their help. Eventually they were put in touch with the charity Settled, which provides help to Ukrainians with the visa process. The charity advised applying for a visa naming themselves as sponsors, despite the new rules, in the hope the Home Office would make an exception. But their application was left in limbo, with no decision, so it could not be challenged. ""Every day we checked our email,"" Ivan says, describing the wait as ""painful"". Then in January, the government announced it was reversing the changes brought in under the Conservatives, so Ukrainians could once again sponsor their children to join them in the UK. When Ivan and Olesia received an email confirming their children's visas had been approved they were overjoyed. ""I cannot explain that feeling,"" says Ivan. ""It was the best feeling in the world."" Settled has supported a number of Ukrainian families like Ivan and Olesia, who are now starting to get their applications approved. But others hoping to bring relatives such as siblings or parents remain separated. Although Ukraine has signalled its willingness to enter peace negotiations, with the US pushing for an end to the war, the UK has given Ukrainians the right to apply to stay in the country for a further 18 months. While Ivan hopes his family can return to Ukraine one day, he adds: ""Even if the war stopped tomorrow there is no certainty for our region."" For Olesia, having her children with her means she can now start to rebuild their lives in the UK. ""There is probably no other feeling like having your children beside you. You don't worry; you don't start your day by reading the news about what happened in Ukraine, where there were attacks,"" she says. ""You fall asleep peacefully and wake up peacefully because your children are next to you, and nothing else is needed.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rz0jvvpwwo,European leaders back 'realistic' Arab plan for Gaza,"Leading European nations have said they support an Arab-backed plan for the reconstruction of Gaza that would cost $53 billion (£41 billion) and avoid displacing Palestinians from the territory. The plan, drawn up by Egypt and endorsed by Arab leaders, has been rejected by Israel and by US President Donald Trump, who presented his own vision to turn the Gaza Strip into a ""Middle East Riviera"". On Saturday the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and Britain welcomed the plan, which calls for Gaza to be rebuilt over five years, as ""realistic"". In a statement, they said the proposal promised ""swift and sustainable improvement of the catastrophic living conditions"" for the people of Gaza. The plan calls for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed to the territory. The committee would be responsible for overseeing humanitarian aid and temporarily managing Gaza's affairs under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority. The proposal was drawn up amid growing concern that Gaza's fragile ceasefire deal could collapse after the six-week first phase expired on 1 March. Israel has blocked aid from entering the territory to pressure Hamas to accept a new US proposal for a temporary extension of the truce, during which more hostages held in Gaza would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But Hamas has insisted that the second phase of the ceasefire, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops, should begin as agreed. Israel will send a negotiating team to Qatar on Monday to take part in talks on extending the ceasefire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said. It remains unclear if or when the second phase of the ceasefire agreement will be implemented. But a Hamas spokesman, Abdel Latif al-Qanoua, spoke of ""positive indicators"" for next week's talks. The Arab-backed plan for Gaza's future is an alternative to Trump's idea for the US to take over the territory and resettle its population. Egypt presented the plan at an emergency Arab League summit on Tuesday and it was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. But both the White House and Israeli foreign ministry said it failed to address realities in Gaza. ""Residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,"" Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump's National Security Council, said late on Tuesday. ""President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,"" the statement added. The statement issued by the four European countries on Saturday said they were ""committed to working with the Arab initiative"" and they appreciated the ""important signal"" the Arab states had sent by developing it. The statement said Hamas ""must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel any more"" and that the four countries ""support the central role for the Palestinian Authority and the implementation of its reform agenda"". Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have had to leave their homes since the start of hostilities. Israel began military operations after Hamas's October 2023 attack which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 more taken hostage. Gaza has suffered vast destruction with a huge humanitarian impact. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and much infrastructure across the strip has been levelled by air strikes.

Roman Dobrokhotov, editor-in-chief of The Insider, was followed through Europe by Bulgarian spies who were working for Moscow - three of whom were convicted on Friday. Dobrokhotov told the BBC: ""I'm very lucky to be alive"". The Russian national believes he and his fellow investigative journalist, the Bulgarian Christo Grozev, were targeted because of their exposés on Russia. They revealed Russia's role in a string of deadly incidents, including the nerve agent attacks in Salisbury in 2018 and on the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020. In December 2020, on the day that investigative group Bellingcat published its exposé on the Navalny poisoning, the man who directed the Russian spy cell sent a message saying: ""We'd be interested in a Bulgarian guy working for Bellingcat Christo Grozev."" Jan Marsalek, who instructed the spy ring on behalf of the Russian intelligence services, wrote that Grozev was the ""lead investigator in the Navalny case"". His friend and fellow target Dobrokhotov said this was the moment when they became a major focus, as Putin was so disturbed by what had been revealed. ""I think that it was Putin directly,"" he said. ""In this dictatorship, you would never take responsibility on your own to do such a political stuff. You will always have a direct order from the president."" A message sent by Marsalek to fellow spy Orlin Roussev - who ran the UK-based group from a former guest house in Norfolk - demonstrated inside knowledge of Putin's thinking. He wrote: ""Personally I find Grozev not to be a very valuable target but apparently Putin seriously hates him."" After 2020, the spy cell followed Grozev and Dobrokhotov throughout Europe, spying on them on aeroplanes, in hotels and in private properties. They discussed kidnapping and even killing the men. There was talk of smuggling Dobrokhotov out of the UK in a small boat from the Norfolk coast, after which he would be taken back to Russia. Dobrokhotov said it was clear this would have resulted in his death. It was in January 2023, the month before police arrested members of the cell in the UK, that Dobrokhotov said he was ""warned that I shouldn't leave the country because it can be dangerous"". He had not realised that he was being followed by the Bulgarian spies, who got so near to him on one flight that they saw the Pin code for his mobile phone. He thinks the police action sends a signal. ""Vladimir Putin doesn't understand messages in words, only in actions,"" Dobrokhotov said. ""So he understands messages like, for example, Ukraine got long-range missiles. That's a message that he can understand. ""And when his spies are arrested and imprisoned for a big sentence, that's also a message that he can understand."" He thinks the use of Bulgarians working in normal jobs shows the limits of Russian espionage after so many professional spies were expelled from the West, but that spy cells like the Bulgarian one are no less dangerous.  Speaking about what motivates him, Dobrokhotov said he wants ""to change Russia"" because he does not want to live in a country that ""kills people just because they're doing journalism or because they are criticising the government"". He said that ""while we are existing, it is very difficult for Vladimir Putin to feel strength inside the country"" and that ""we will be someone who he will try to eliminate for the rest of his life"". ""We're in a situation that only some of us will survive, either we or Vladimir Putin and his team."" On Friday Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, were found guilty of conspiracy to spy, while Roussev, 47, and Biser Dzhambazov, 43, had previously admitted the same charge. A sixth Bulgarian, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, pleaded guilty to spying. Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents.",2025-03-08T04:36:44.386Z,Daniel De Simone
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy83r93l208o,Poland announces military training plan for all men,"Work is under way to make all men in Poland undergo military training, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. In a speech to the Polish parliament, Tusk said the government aimed to give full details in the coming months. Efforts are being made to ""prepare large-scale military training for every adult male in Poland,"" he told the Sejm. ""We will try to have a model ready by the end of this year so that every adult male in Poland is trained in the event of war, so that this reserve is comparable and adequate to the potential threats."" Tusk said the Ukrainian army has 800,000 soldiers, whilst Russia has around 1.3 million and he wants to increase the size of the Polish army, including reservists, to 500,000 from around 200,000 now. ""We're talking about the need to have an army of half a million in Poland, including the reservists,"" he said. ""It seems if we organise things wisely, and I'm talking constantly with the Minister of Defence, we will have to use several courses of action. That means the reservists, but also intensive training to make those who do not go into the army fully-fledged and competent soldiers during a conflict,"" he added. Tusk said women may also undergo military training, but ""war, is still to a greater extent the domain of men"". The prime minister said his government was also ""carefully examining"" France's proposal to include Europe under its nuclear umbrella. ""I would like to know first of all in detail what it means in terms of the authority over these weapons,"" he said. Tusk pointed out Ukraine was invaded after it got rid of its own nuclear arsenal, adding Warsaw would like to acquire its own nuclear weapons, however remote a possibility that may be. ""Today, it is clear that we would be safer if we had our own nuclear arsenal, that is beyond doubt. In any case the road to that would be very long and there would have to be a consensus too,"" he said. Poland is already planning to spend 4.7% of its economic output on defence this year, the highest proportion in the Nato alliance. Tusk told parliament that spending should increase to 5% of GDP. Earlier, President Duda proposed amending the constitution to make defence spending at a level of 4% of GDP compulsory The prime minister also said he supports Poland withdrawing from the Ottawa convention that bans the use of antipersonnel landmines, and also possibly from the Dublin convention that bans the use of cluster munitions. Poland has ramped up defence spending since Russia's full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in 2022. It has signed arms contracts worth around $20bn (£15.5bn) with the United States to buy 250 M1A2 Abrams battle tanks, 32 F-35 jets, 96 Apache helicopters, Javelin missiles, and artillery rocket systems. Warsaw has also signed contracts with South Korea to purchase K2 tanks and FA-50 light combat aircraft. There is growing anxiety among Poles about their future security following US President Donald Trump's decision to suspend military supplies to Ukraine. Most Poles believe supporting Ukraine is in their own security interests. Mirosław Kaznowski, the deputy mayor of Milanówek, a small town outside Warsaw, told BBC News this week that a friend of his has decided to invest in a start-up to build low-cost underground bomb shelters for businesses and homes. His friend said interest was high, he added.",2025-03-07T15:55:55.175Z,Adam Easton
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmjewpkje9o,They lost 52 soldiers fighting alongside the US. Now they feel threatened by Trump,"All his adult life, Colonel Soren Knudsen stepped forward when his country called. And when its allies did. He fought alongside US troops, notably in Afghanistan, and for a time was Denmark's most senior officer there. He counted 58 rocket attacks during his duty. ""I was awarded a Bronze Star Medal by the United States and they gave me the Stars and Stripes. They have been hanging on my wall in our house ever since and I have proudly shown them to everybody."" Then something changed. ""After JD Vance's statement on Greenland, the president's disrespect for internationally acknowledged borders, I took the Stars and Stripes down and the medal has been put away,"" Soren says, his voice breaking a little. This week before Congress, the US president doubled down on his desire to seize the world's biggest island: Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. ""My first feeling was that it hurts, and the second is that I'm offended,"" Col Knudsen laments. I meet him in the first weeks of his retirement outside Denmark's 18th Century royal residence, Amalienborg Palace in the heart of Copenhagen. Abruptly, pipers strike up and soldiers stream by. Today's Changing of the Guard comes at a time when the Trump administration has not just tweaked but defenestrated most assumptions around US-European security that have held fast for 80 years. ""It's about values and when those values are axed by what we thought was an ally, it gets very tough to watch."" Soren says with his American wife Gina at his side. ""Denmark freely and without question joined those efforts where my husband served,” she says. ""So it comes as a shock to hear threats from a country that I also love and to feel that alliance is being trampled on. This feels personal, not like some abstract foreign policy tactic."" Soren has not given up all hope though. ""It's my hope and my prayer that I will one day be able to put [the flag] back on the wall,"" he confides. There's no sign his prayers will be answered soon. Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, goes to the polls next week with all the main parties backing independence at some point in the future. A takeover by Donald Trump – potentially by force – is not on the ballot paper. Not far from the royal palace stands Denmark's memorial to its soldiers lost in recent battle. Carved on the stone-covered walls are the names of those killed alongside their Western allies. The section honouring the fallen in the US-led invasion of Afghanistan is particularly sizeable. Denmark lost 44 soldiers in Afghanistan, which as a proportion of its less than six million population, was more than any other ally apart from the US. In Iraq, eight Danish soldiers died. This is why the president's words sting so much. One man very well placed to consider what Trump's ambitions for Greenland actually amount to is Anders Fogh Rasmussen. ""President Trump's declaration of intention to maybe take Greenland by force is very similar to President Putin's rhetoric when it comes to Ukraine,"" he tells the BBC. The former prime minister of Denmark and ex-secretary general of the Nato alliance argues this is the moment Denmark and the rest of Europe must step up to better protect itself if the US is not willing to. ""Since my childhood, I have admired the United States and their role as the world's policeman. And I think we need a policeman to ensure international law and order but if the United States does not want to execute that role, then Europe must be able to defend itself, to stand on its own feet."" Fogh Rasmussen doesn't though believe the policeman is about to turn felon. ""I would like to stress I don't think at the end of the day that the Americans will take Greenland by force."" President Trump first talked about a Greenland takeover in his first term of office before returning to the theme at the start of this year. But now, after blindsiding supposed allies with his latest moves on Ukraine, tariffs, as well as the Middle East, Denmark is urgently trying to assess the true threat. For many younger Danes, control of Greenland is plain wrong - an unfathomable colonial hangover. It doesn't mean they want it handed straight over to the US instead. ""We do have connections to Greenland,"" says music student Molly. ""Denmark and Greenland are quite separated I would say but I still have friends from there so this does affect me quite personally."" ""I find it really scary,"" says 18-year-old music student Luukas. ""Everything he sees, he goes after. And the thing with the oil and money, he doesn't care about the climate, he doesn't care about anyone or anything."" His friend Clara chips in that Trump is now so powerful he can ""affect their day-to-day life"" from thousands of miles away, in what is an era of unprecedented jeopardy. In light of President Trump's suspension of military aid for Ukraine and his deep reluctance to fund Europe's security, Denmark has been at the heart of the drive to boost defence spending across the continent. The country has just announced it will allocate more than 3% of its GDP to defence spending in 2025 and 2026 to protect against future aggression from Russia or elsewhere. Meanwhile, security analyst Hans Tino Hansen stands in front of a huge screen in what he calls his ""ops room"", at his Copenhagen headquarters. ""This map is where we update on a daily basis our threat picture based on alerts and incidents all over the world,"" says Hans, who has been running Risk Intelligence for the past 25 years. As part of Denmark's increased defence spending, it's bolstering its strength in the ""High North"" with an extra two billion euros announced in January and three new Arctic naval vessels and investment in long-range drones. Hans believes Arctic security can be tightened further, not by an American takeover - but with new deals that restore US influence. ""If you make more agreements, both on defence and security, but also economic ones and on raw materials, then we are more or less going back to where we were in the 50s and 60s."" But the story stretches further back than the mid-20th Century. ""If you look at this globe, Greenland is the most centrally located place on Earth,"" says world-renowned geologist Prof Minik Rosing, gesticulating in his wood-panelled office. The serenity of his room reflects the temperament of a man who grew up in a settlement of just ""seven or eight people"" in the Nuuk fjord of the island. But a key reason his homeland is now coming under increasing scrutiny from outsiders is the rich mineral deposits beneath the Arctic ice. We've seen how Ukraine's natural resources have caught President Trump's eye in much the same way. ""All these minerals that they talk about like rare metals, rare earth elements - they are actually not rare. What is rare is the use of them,"" he reasons. Prof Rosing says the vastness of Greenland and the lack of infrastructure are just two elements why the island may not be the cashpoint some Americans are hoping for. ""They are a minuscule part of the mining industry and the economy of extracting them is very uncertain, whereas the investment to start extracting is very high. The risk of the investment is too high relative to the potential gain."" The current Greenlandic government says there will be a vote on independence at some point following next week's election. Although surely unintentional, President Trump's designs on the island have shone a light on a desire found among the Inuit to finally break free from 300 years of Danish control. But Prof Rosing believes, despite all the latent mineral wealth, his fellow Greenlanders are in no hurry to forego the annual block grant of the equivalent of £480m (€570m) it receives from Copenhagen. This accounts for easily more than half of the island's public budget. ""People talk about health services, schools, the next outboard engine they want on their boat and what is the price of gas and all of these things that normal people do,"" he says. ""It's not like they stand up with a big knife, wave it in the air and shout independence, independence."" In terms of Trump's apparent obsession with taking Greenland, Fogh Rasmussen fears there may be a troubling conclusion to be drawn. One that would render the Danes unable to do business with a man whose view on territorial integrity is so wildly incompatible from theirs. ""I understand very well the American strategic interest in the minerals, but when it comes to mining in Greenland, they have shown no interest,"" he says. ""That leaves me with the concern that maybe it's not about security, maybe it's not about minerals, maybe it is just a question of expanding the territory of the United States. ""And that's actually a point where we are not able to accommodate President Trump."" Additional reporting by Kostas Kallergis",2025-03-08T06:07:01.581Z,Nick Beake
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627685p21eo,How spy ring did Russia's dirty work from the UK,"Roman Dobrokhotov is used to looking over his shoulder. The Russian journalist's investigations into Vladimir Putin's regime - one of which unmasked the agents responsible for the 2018 Salisbury poisonings - have made him a target of the Kremlin. But as the Insider editor waited on the tarmac to board a commercial flight from Budapest to Berlin in 2021, where he was to give evidence in a murder trial, he didn't notice the brunette woman stood behind him. He thought nothing of it when she took a seat close to his. Nor did he see the camera strapped to her shoulder, quietly recording. That morning, the woman had flown from Luton to Budapest to locate the mark. Dobrokhotov's flight information had been obtained in advance. As the aircraft approached its destination, the woman, a Bulgarian – Katrin Ivanova – sent a message on Telegram. Then two more. Her partner, Biser Dzhambazov, with whom she lived in Harrow, north London, was waiting for her and Dobrokhotov in Berlin. Another woman, an airport worker identified only as Cvetka, had already flown a dummy run of the route. Waiting in Berlin, she was another pair of eyes. They'd lost him. Operational for years, the cell tracked Russia's enemies across Europe. Its leaders plotted honeytraps, kidnap and murder in service of the Kremlin. Following a trial, three members were convicted on 7 March at the Old Bailey in London for their part in the conspiracy. Three more had already pleaded guilty. ""We're in a situation where only some of us will survive,"" Dobrokhotov would later tell the BBC. ""It will be either Russian journalists and human rights watchers, or Vladimir Putin and his killers."" Watching events in Berlin unfold from the UK was the final member of the Telegram group, another Bulgarian, Orlin Roussev, 47. An associate recalls Orlin Roussev as a man fascinated by espionage. An email address associated with him includes the 007 sobriquet of the world's most famous secret agent. He moved to Britain in 2009, before he set up a company involved in signals intelligence – the interception of communications or electronic signals. When police officers searched the faded 33-room Great Yarmouth former guest house in which he lived with his wife and stepson, they discovered, in the assessment of one expert, ""a vast amount of technical surveillance equipment which could be used to enable intrusive surveillance"". They might have been less dry. It was an Aladdin's cave disguised as a cluttered seaside relic; sophisticated communications interception devices worth £175,000; radio frequency jammers; covert cameras hidden in smoke detectors, a pen, sunglasses, even men's ties; a horde of fake identity documents and equipment to make more. An encrypted hard drive was left open. Telegram conversations were visible on Roussev's laptop. Among the masses of equipment, police discovered the business card of a one-time finance executive, Jan Marsalek. Roussev first met Jan Marsalek in 2015, introduced, he recalled, by a mutual acquaintance he had met at the offices of a British investor and wealth adviser. In emails from that time seen by the BBC, Marsalek enlists Roussev's help in acquiring a secure mobile phone from a Chinese company. Then, Jan Marsalek was the respected chief operating officer of German payments processing company Wirecard. While reports criticising Wirecard's business practices had started to appear in the Financial Times, the company's reputation as a star performer in the European fintech sector, valued in excess of £20 billion at its peak, was intact. Now, he was directing operations as Roussev's controller on the run from fraud charges - the subject of an Interpol red notice - following the company's 2020 collapse. Together, the pair conceived operations targeting journalists, dissidents, politicians, even Ukrainian soldiers thought to be training at a US military installation in Stuttgart. They discussed selling US drones captured from Ukrainian battlefields to China. And they did it for Russia. Linked to the state's intelligence services, Marsalek is believed to be hiding in Moscow. He faces no charges in the UK. The group Roussev employed, all Bulgarians, were not the spies of popular imagination. Alongside Dzhambazov, a medical courier, and Ivanova, a laboratory assistant, he employed a beautician with a salon in Acton, Vanya Gaberova; a painter and decorator, Tihomir Ivanchev; plus an MMA fighter nicknamed ""The Destroyer"" who wore his fights on his face, Ivan Stoyanov. A neighbour who knew two of the accused was sceptical they could be guilty. They were too stupid and didn't know anything, the neighbour asserted, though they admired the fighter's ""enormous calves"". But they were not ineffective – Roman Dobrokhotov recognised none of the group's faces when pictures were shown to him by police. The group operated a clear hierarchy. Roussev reported to Marsalek, who reported to his ""friends in Russia"". Roussev managed the rest of the Bulgarians, who he referred to as his ""minions"", Dzhambazov chief among them. ""There are no bosses here,"" Dzambhazov wrote, as he issued instructions to Ivanchev. Nonetheless, ""minion"" was attached to the decorator's number in Dzhambazov's phone. The group dynamics were complicated. Dzhambazov and Ivanova were in a long term relationship and lived together. Gaberova and Ivanchev were in a relationship until 2022. But it was Dzhambazov and Gaberova police found in bed together when they burst into the beautician's northwest London flat in February 2023. Between August 2020 and February 2023, Marsalek and Roussev exchanged 78,747 messages on the Telegram messaging app. They reveal at least six operations the spy cell was tasked with over a period of years – four of which targeted individuals who were enemies of Putin's regime. As well as Dobrokhotov, the Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev was watched at home in Vienna. Cameras in the window of a rented apartment nearby were trained on his front door. He was tailed on flights and photographed in a Valencia hotel eating breakfast with co-founder of the Bellingcat investigative collective Elliott Higgins. A thorn in the side of Russian intelligence services, he was observed in Bulgaria meeting with an arms trader who had been the victim of an assassination attempt Grozev linked to the Russian state. Gaberova was instructed to befriend him. In Montenegro, the cell searched for Kirill Kachur, who had worked for the Investigative Committee of Russia until he fell foul of the Kremlin. They were anxious to impress. A second Russian intelligence team circled, including a chain-smoking blonde woman referred to only as ""Red Sparrow"". Marsalek and Roussev discussed the kidnap and murder of both Grozev and Kachur. It wasn't an empty threat – a colleague of Kachur's had separately been taken to Moscow. A former Kazakh politician living with refugee status in London, Bergey Ryskaliyev, was targeted at a luxury apartment in Hyde Park. Further reconnaissance took place at his home. Ivan Stoyanov, who acknowledged his part in the conspiracy, was spotted parked in a Toyota Prius outside his address. Suspicious, an assistant of Mr Ryskaliyev noted the licence plate. When confronted, the MMA fighter claimed he was working for a Kensington hospital, delivering tests. The next day, an NHS logo had been placed in the windscreen. Prosecutors said providing information on a political dissident like Ryskaliyev ""is predicated on Russian attempts to control diplomatic relations"". Indeed, Marsalek would further task Roussev with another project: a hare-brained scheme to initiate a staged protest at the Kazakh Embassy featuring blood dropped from drones, an astroturf human rights campaign involving Just Stop Oil, a letter addressed to the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, advertising on London buses and unrealised deepfake pornographic video of the Kazakh president's son. Russia would then help nervous Kazakh security services ""uncover"" the ""activists"" responsible. In February 2022, Telegram exchanges between Marsalek and Roussev reveal a preoccupation with following Christo Grozev to Kyiv, where he was believed to have travelled. Their offers to help were rebuffed. Fewer than three weeks later, Russian tanks surged across Ukraine's eastern, southern and northern borders. Later that year, Marsalek asked Roussev if one of the cell's three IMSI grabbers – sophisticated communications interception equipment – could be deployed to spy on Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. Roussev promised to retrieve it from his ""Indiana Jones garage"", where it was ""gathering dust"". Marsalek returned to the idea repeatedly. By February 2023, Roussev and Marsalek were plotting to send Dzhambazov and ""one more person"" to Stuttgart, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers to be training on Patriot missile systems. Had they successfully deployed and captured Ukrainian troops' mobile phone data as planned, they might have used it to pinpoint those same troops on the battlefield – leading Russian forces to Western-supplied Ukrainian air defences. ""This was espionage activity of the highest level of seriousness,"" prosecutor Alison Morgan KC told the jury at the Old Bailey. Before their plans could be put into action, they were arrested – Dzhambazov, Ivanova, Gaberova and Stoyanov in London, Roussev in his guest house. Though Ivanchev identified himself to police outside Gaberova's flat, he would not be arrested for another year. In his first police interview, he told officers he had spoken to MI5 in the interim. The interview was paused. None of the six denied their actions. Roussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov pleaded guilty before trial. Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev denied knowing they were working for Russia. The jury disagreed. Ivanova, Gaberova and Ivanchev were found guilty after the jury deliberated for over 32 hours. Ivanova was also found guilty of possessing multiple false identity documents. They could face up to 14 years in prison. They will be sentenced in May. But it is not the end. ""If there is no regime change, there will be new and new teams of people who come to kill or kidnap you,"" Roman Dobrokhotov told the BBC. ""This is this actually something that motivates us to work. ""From the very beginning, I was sure it was something directly controlled by Vladimir Putin. ""In his dictatorship you would never take responsibility on your own to do such political stuff. ""You'd always have a direct order from the president. ""Putin is a psychopath who has no borders,"" he said. Message extracts have been edited for brevity.",2025-03-07T15:36:27.909Z,Chris Bell
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17qnxrq1y7o,Why politicians say St Patrick's trip makes a difference,"St Patrick's Day is associated with its fair share of traditions, from wearing a sprig of shamrock, to attending a church service, to sipping one (or several) pints of stout. For politicians from the island of Ireland, there's one other annual tradition - a visit to Washington DC. Every March, dozens of people including politicians, businesspeople, and lobbyists from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland descend on the capital of the United States. This year, a number of Northern Ireland politicians are refusing to make the trip over Donald Trump's policies. But what is the point of the events in the week running up to St Patrick's Day? And if they didn't happen, would anyone back home notice any difference? Two of the main things that governments in Dublin and Belfast - as well as businesses - want to see come out of the trips, are US investment and strong trading relationships. Two men who have been to Washington several times as part of St Patrick's Day events say there is no doubt the trips deliver results. Steve Aiken took part in St Patrick's Day trips as the chief executive of the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce, and later as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. The Stormont assembly member said it was impossible to build relationships and to improve business and political ties without meeting face to face. ""It is all about the ability to talk to people you do not normally get the chance to talk to,"" he said. ""As we learned during Covid, doing business over Zoom is not really doing business. ""You need to be in a room to do it, and if you want to influence you have to be there to talk the talk; you cannot do it from 3,500 miles away."" Aiken said that contrary to what the perception might be, it was not ""a holiday"". ""You need to be over your brief and able to talk authoritatively and you need to have the answers to those questions – and you will be asked lots of questions and you will have a lot thrown at you,"" he said. Former Sinn Féin politician Máirtín Ó Muilleoir knows about both the benefits of being in the room and the disappointment of missing out. The publisher of the Irish Echo attended the White House twice in that role, but did not travel to Washington during his time as Northern Ireland's finance minister, after the Stormont Executive collapsed two months before the 2017 festivities. He said the mood in the United States in the run-up to St Patrick's Day made it the ideal time for Irish politicians and businesses to make their pitch. ""You think of the biggest companies in the US, they will all have promotions linked to St Patrick's Day,"" he said. ""You will go to a city in the US where there will be adverts everywhere. ""That means they are already doing some of the work for you."" He said he believed there would be a major financial services announcement for Belfast in the coming days. One of the eye-catching parts of the St Patrick's Day schedule in Washington is when the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) hands over a bowl of shamrock to the US president in the Oval Office. It is a tradition that dates back to 1952 and was part of a move by the Irish ambassador at the time to improve relations between the two countries after they had soured over Ireland's neutrality in World War Two. The tradition has continued and is an opportunity for the leader of a country as small as the Republic of Ireland to meet the US president face to face. Apart from helping to develop a positive relationship between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United States, it is slightly harder to pin down direct outcomes from the yearly visits - after all, there is a lot more to the relationship than just St Patrick's Day. In the 1990s, in particular, the visits were seen as important in the process that eventually led to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which largely ended the worst of three decades of violence known as the Troubles. In 1995, the then Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams attended the White House - a year after President Bill Clinton intervened to grant him a US visa - a move opposed by the UK government. Five years later, and two years after the 1998 Belfast Agreement, Adams posed for photos at the White House with President Clinton and then UUP leader David Trimble - a reflection of how times had changed. Both Aiken and Ó Muilleoir say the visits are key for investment and US jobs in Northern Ireland. In 2024 there were 285 US firms in Northern Ireland employing 31,915 people - up from 140 firms and 21,270 employees in 2010. But Esmond Birnie, senior economist at Ulster University, said a direct link could not be drawn. ""It is impossible to quantify whether these political visits actually lead to investment or sales, so you cannot really prove it one way or another,"" he said. ""On balance, the benefits are likely to be smaller than the fundamentals of training, skills, innovation and productivity and so forth."" Dr Birnie said factors such as Northern Ireland's location in both the UK and the European single market, relatively low labour costs and relatively low-level and unobtrusive regulations by continental European standards all made US companies keen to invest. There was once a time when Irish-Americans were prominent at the top of US politics, with figures such as Senator Teddy Kennedy and House of Representatives Speaker Tip O'Neill promoting Irish interests in the corridors of power. This was partly the result of years of high levels of emigration from Ireland to the US - the 1930 US census recorded 923,600 residents who were born on the island of Ireland. By the turn of the century that had fallen to 169,600. The end of the Troubles also meant fewer headlines about Northern Ireland. ""One of the problems every politician or influencer from the island of Ireland has – north or south – is to keep people interested in what is going on,"" Aiken said. ""With everything else going on in the world, we are quite far down the list."" Ó Muilleoir, however, said Ireland still had a privileged position in the US. ""I once met the consul of Switzerland in Manhattan and I was bemoaning the sense we did not have as much influence in New York anymore,"" he said ""He said he had walked from Wall Street to Central Park and every block he saw an Irish flag – but he did not see any Swiss flags."" Sinn Féin is boycotting events this year over President Donald Trump's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict, meaning Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O'Neill, the party's deputy leader, will not be present. The Social Democratic and Labour Party also said it would not attend if invited, and the Alliance Party is taking a similar stance. Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly, of the Democratic Unionist Party, has said she will go to Washington DC, saying it was important to ""maintain long and rewarding"" relationships with the US. Ó Muilleoir said politicians had to weigh up the pros and cons. ""This is probably the most difficult time to be in the White House on St Patrick's,"" he said. ""We are not the only people with moral dilemmas; it is for everybody to make their own choice.""",2025-03-08T02:08:51.295Z,Luke Sproule
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czedpnen168o,"Data, waves and wind to be counted in the economy","Wind and waves are set to be included in calculations of the size of countries' economies for the first time, as part of changes approved at the United Nations. Assets like oilfields were already factored in under the rules - last updated in 2008. This update aims to capture areas that have grown since then, such as the cost of using up natural resources and the value of data. The changes come into force in 2030, and could mean an increase in estimates of the size of the UK economy making promises to spend a fixed share of the economy on defence or aid more expensive. The economic value of wind and waves can be estimated from the price of all the energy that can be generated from the turbines in a country. The update also treats data as an asset in its own right on top of the assets that house it like servers and cables. Governments use a common rule book for measuring the size of their economies and how they grow over time. These changes to the rule book are ""tweaks, rather than a rewrite"", according to Prof Diane Coyle of the University of Cambridge. Ben Zaranko of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calls it an ""accounting"" change, rather than a real change. He explains: ""We'd be no better off in a material sense, and tax revenues would be no higher."" But it could make economies look bigger, creating a possible future spending headache for the UK government. For example, Labour has committed to allocating fixed percentages of the size of the economy on defence and aid. If the new rules increase the estimated size of the economy by 2-3% in 2030, it might add £2bn to defence spending. That is a tiny share of the total government budget, but large compared with the cuts to overseas aid (£6bn) that are currently funding extra defence spending or the headroom that the government has left to meet its self-imposed fiscal rules (£10bn). The government spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will not be including the impact of these new rules on the government finances in their assessment of the government finances this March. This makes the new rules a possible future headache for the Chancellor rather than an immediate one. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",2025-03-08T01:52:58.145Z,Robert Cuffe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7v1ejv01go,This city helped the US back Ukraine. Now its role is uncertain,"US President Donald Trump's pause on military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine has left the war-torn country's residents uncertain about their futures and rattled America's European allies. But it also hit far closer to home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a city about 4,700 miles (7,560km) away from Kyiv that has played its own small role in the conflict. Scranton is known as the setting for the American version of The Office television show, and as the birthplace of former President Joe Biden - one of Ukraine's biggest backers. But after Russia invaded Ukraine, it has become known as the home of the Scranton Army Artillery Plant among those who have followed the conflict closely. Owned by the US government and operated by defence contractor General Dynamics, the plant produces the 155mm artillery rounds - a key munition that has helped the Ukrainians keep Russian advances at bay. These rounds are used daily, as the conflict grinds on into World War I-style trench battles and artillery strikes. ""Scranton is the only place the metal cases for 155mm ammunition are made in the US,"" said former Defense Department official Christine Michienzi, who led the effort to scale up production of weapons systems sent to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toured the plant during a whirlwind trip to Scranton in September 2024, shaking hands with staff and observing its machinery. Scranton is one of three plants in Pennsylvania that has increased production of the 155 mm rounds since the start of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Between 2009 to 2017, they collectively produced about 9,000 rounds per month. By the time of Zelensky's visit last year, the facilities had ramped up their output to 36,000 rounds monthly, the US Army said. During the Oval Office meeting that caused the Trump administration's relationship with Ukraine to collapse, Vice-President JD Vance cited the tour to accuse Zelensky of campaigning ""for the opposition"" during his visit. Despite all the politicial drama, this Pennslyvania community continues to see its work as representing the US commitment to Ukraine, said Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti. ""We have multiple Ukrainian churches here. We have quite the diaspora of Ukrainian Americans,"" Cognetti said. St Vladimir Ukrainian Catholic Church in Scranton has raised funds for the war effort and hosted Ukrainian soldiers at community events. ""Scranton has a very proud history of supporting Ukraine,"" Cognetti told the BBC, ""and it's been a really tough couple of weeks here, as we see that support erode from the US administration."" Cognetti was unsettled by the Oval Office argument between Trump, Zelensky, and Vance last Friday. ""To see US policy shift and potentially to have the US really turn its back on Ukraine is really appalling,"" she said. The Scranton artillery plant ""ensures warfighters have the ammo when and where needed, and continues to bolster US stockpiles around the globe,"" said Lt Gen Chris Mohan, deputy commanding general and acting commander, in a statement about Zelensky's visit. Cognetti said that the plant had added ""many dozens"" of jobs and increased capacity during the Ukraine war, estimating that about 400 people worked there when Zelensky visited. But with the Trump administration now pressuring Zelensky to end the war, Scranton's role in geopolitics could be winding down. US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz confirmed on Wednesday that the White House had paused intelligence sharing with Kyiv, telling reporters: ""We have taken a step back."" The Trump administration is reviewing ""all aspects of this relationship"", he added. Republican lawmakers have backed Trump's recent actions, which they see as key to negotiating an end to the war. ""I think the president just wants to get everybody to the table, and I think he's making progress,"" South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds told reporters. There are different estimates for how much military aid the US has given Ukraine, a BBC Verify analysis found. The German-based Kiel Institute estimated the total at $119.7bn (£94.3bn). The US Department of Defense provided a total of $182.8bn, which includes spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Fedir Venislavsky, a member of the Ukrainian parliament's defence committee, told the BBC that without US military aid, front-line soldiers would be able to last ""maybe six months."" The region is home to multiple military manufacturing plants, including a Lockheed Martin facility and the larger Tobyhanna Army Depot, which also produces some supplies for Ukraine. Representatives for the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant declined to comment on how the pause could impact the plant and jobs. On Tuesday, cars pulled into the secure facility as usual, and its car park appeared full. ""Even if there is a permanent freeze, Scranton will continue to produce large numbers of 155mm ammunition for the foreseeable future,"" said Ms Michienzi. ""It will take many years to manufacture millions of rounds to replenish US inventories, plus rounds for some of our allies."" Any effect would be minor for Scranton's economy, local officials said. The plant ""is not the largest employer by any stretch,"" said Bob Durkin, president of the non-partisan Scranton Chamber of Commerce. ""But it's a very important employer. The jobs are really high quality jobs. They are well paying, family sustaining jobs."" Outside the plant's gates, Scranton's perspective on the war remains divided. Though Scranton, in north-east Pennsylvania, is a historically Democratic area, Republicans have made political gains in the region. In the 2024 presidential election, Trump won the state, but narrowly lost Lackawanna County, where Scranton is located, to then-Vice-President Kamala Harris. However, in the House race, Republican Rob Bresnahan ousted Democratic congressman, Matt Cartwright, by just 6,200 votes. Trump campaigned against US spending on Ukraine, a pledge that resonated with his base. On Tuesday, just before his speech before Congress, denizens at the local Poor Richards dive bar were split on Ukraine - and what role Scranton ought to play on the world stage. ""I feel really angry about the way Trump handled the meeting with Zelensky,"" said Brandon Lux, 35, who worked in mental healthcare in Scranton. ""Halting all government funding to Ukraine right now, I think that that will definitely have implications for what happens here in our city."" But other residents felt Trump was correct to pressure Zelensky and to reassess Biden's support of the embattled country. ""We don't have money to give them, we have to take care of our people first,"" said Fran Fitzgerald, who described herself as a ""big fan"" of Trump. Ms Fitzgerald said she hoped the Trump administration could direct the funds being used in Ukraine to projects like fixing Scranton's ""terrible roads"" and potholes. Mike Pierson, an electrician, voted for Trump but does not necessarily agree with all his actions so far. The self-identified independent worried that Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency taskforce would endanger his Social Security benefits. He hopes to retire within the next five years. But Mr Pierson echoed the president's argument that the US should not be spending money abroad on conflicts like Ukraine, but back at home. ""We're the world's bank, we're the world's insurance policy,"" he said. ""We need to stop.""",2025-03-06T10:12:30.777Z,Kayla Epstein
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0q964851po,Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?,"When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine, his aim was to sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in a matter of days. He wanted to overthrow the pro-Western government and return Ukraine to Russia's sphere of influence. Putin failed, but more than three years on a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands, and the US - until recently Ukraine's strongest ally - has paused aid under President Donald Trump and blamed Ukraine for starting the war. As Putin launched the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, he gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history. Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government. Putin then prompted a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow. But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale. Putin had just recognised the rebel states as independent. Then, as the invasion began, he said the people there - many of whom are Russian speakers - needed protection from the Kyiv ""regime"". A day later, Putin called on Ukraine's military to ""take power into your own hands"" and target the ""gangs of drug addicts and neo-Nazis"" running the government. Putin then added another objective - to ensure Ukraine stayed neutral. He accused the Western defensive alliance, Nato, of trying to gain a foothold in Ukraine to bring its troops closer to Russia's borders. The Russian leader has long questioned Ukraine's right to exist, claiming that ""modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia"" after the communist revolution in 1917. In a long-winded 2021 essay he even suggested ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people"" dating back to the late 9th Century. Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an ""artificial state"". Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine. Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion. Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia. Fact-checking Putin's 'nonsense' history Zelensky - from comedian to wartime leader Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead. ""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two. ""They want to destroy Ukraine politically by destroying the head of state."" Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia. Even now, three years on, Putin refuses direct peace talks with Zelensky ""because of his illegitimacy"" - a false narrative that has been repeated by President Trump. As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution. Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead. Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line. Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997. But it was Russia who launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014. After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia. Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories ""with no aggressive intentions"". Sweden and Finland have joined Nato in the past two years precisely because of the perceived Russian threat. It is part of Ukraine's constitution to join the European Union and Nato, but there was no real prospect of this when the full-scale war began. Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: ""Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine."" He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should ""forget about"" joining the Western alliance. Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones. Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war. Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand ""an inch to the West"". However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Gorbachev said ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time. Read more: What is Nato? At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian ""bullying and genocide, during the war in the east. More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. Germany's chancellor called the allegation ""ridiculous"". The Russian taunts of Nazis in charge in Kyiv are also not correct. Modern Ukraine has no far-right parties in parliament - they failed to get enough votes in the 2019 elections. On top of that, Zelensky is Jewish and many of his relatives were murdered by the Nazis in World War Two. Putin condemns him as a ""disgrace to the Jewish people"", but the US Holocaust Memorial Museum rejects his claims outright, saying he ""misrepresented and misappropriated Holocaust history"". Putin himself was accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court in 2024, although that has been rejected by the Kremlin. Russia's attempt to stop Ukraine leaving its sphere of influence goes back years, and its initial invasion began in 2014 when pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted after months of mass demonstrations. Yanukovych had abandoned an EU deal under Putin's pressure, prompting protests that ended when snipers shot dead dozens of demonstrators. Yanukovych soon fled to Russia. Putin quickly seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and Russian proxies took up arms against the government, occupying parts of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Two attempts to stop the war came to nothing. They were known as the Minsk agreements and were brokered by France, Germany and Russia itself. They reduced the scale of violence, but Zelensky has called them a trap that created a frozen conflict on Russia's terms. Both sides accused each other of violations, and the Kremlin said ultimately the failed accords were a precursor to Moscow's full-scale invasion. The Ukrainian leader has warned the Trump administration not to trust Putin: ""He broke the ceasefire, he killed our people."" How Trump-Zelensky talks collapsed What minerals does Ukraine have? Tracking the war in maps After three years of offensives and counter-offensives, Russian and Ukrainian forces are in a war of attrition on an active front line of more than 1,000km (629 miles). Neither side has any realistic prospect of winning this war. Russia annexed four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine after sham referendums in 2022, and yet it can really only claim to have full control of one of them, Luhansk. Ukrainian forces were able to liberate large areas of the north and parts of the south in 2022, but more recent counter-offensives have not had the same success. They still control part of Russia's Kursk region after launching an offensive there in August 2024, but have lost ground in the east. Much of Russia's firepower has been turned towards the Donetsk region, as towns and villages are destroyed in a slow and grinding advance. The war is taking its toll on Russia's economy, with high interest rates and inflation and defence spending this year of at least 33% of the federal budget. Ukraine has lost a big part of its economic wealth to Russian occupation and destruction in its industrial east. Growth has been hit by attacks on its energy infrastructure. Although inflation and interest rates are high, Ukraine has secured Western aid to cover its budget deficit. Tens of thousands of people have died since Putin sent in the troops in 2022. Ukraine's president has spoken of 43,000 Ukrainian military deaths, but open source site ualosses.org suggests the number is above 70,000. More than 12,000 civilians have lost their lives in Ukraine, according to the UN. Russia rarely admits to military losses, but BBC analysis estimates that Russian deaths could range from 146,194 to 211,169. The war has forced 6.9 million Ukrainians to seek refuge abroad, and a further 3.7 million to flee their homes inside Ukraine. At the start, Putin did not even call it war but a ""special military operation"". Eventually in 2024 he accepted it was, but claimed it was instigated by Kyiv or its ""Western handlers"".  Putin appears to believe that Ukraine should remain in Russia's sphere of influence because of the historical links between the two countries. From 1922-91 Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union and many Ukrainians speak Russian especially in the east, including Volodymyr Zelensky who is a native speaker. Many Russians view Crimea as their own. It was annexed by Catherine the Great in 1783 and handed to Ukraine by Soviet leader Khrushchev in 1954. Ten years earlier, his predecessor Stalin had deported Crimea's Tatar population, so the majority population was ethnic Russian. Since 1991 Ukraine has been an independent state. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect. Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public.",2025-03-10T10:34:13.389Z,Paul Kirby
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20l5dn39w2o,Russia expels two more British diplomats,"A British diplomat and the spouse of another diplomat are being expelled from Russia, the country's domestic security service has said, in what is being seen as the latest tit-for-tat escalation. The two men are accused of ""intelligence and subversive work"" by the Federal Security Service (FSB) which said they had been stripped of their accreditation and ordered to leave Russia within two weeks. The UK Foreign Office said: ""This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff."" Last month, the UK expelled a Russian diplomat - an action taken in response to Moscow's expulsion of a British diplomat in November 2024. The Russian Foreign Ministry had said then that it intended to retaliate to the expulsion. In the past year alone, there have been seven British diplomats expelled from Russia with Moscow accusing them of espionage - allegations denied by the UK. Relations between the UK and Russia have deteriorated to post-Cold War lows in the years following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Monday's reported action, Moscow said it was expelling the diplomats on grounds of espionage. In a statement the FSB said the two had declared ""false information about themselves when receiving permission"" to enter Russia. Russia's foreign ministry said on Monday it had also summoned a representative of the British embassy ""in protest"".  The pair appear to be the first western diplomatic expulsions by Moscow since Russia and the US held talks on restoring relations last month - the first time in three years since the start of the Ukraine war. But relations between Britain and Russia have been further strained as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has resolutely stood by Ukraine. He has pledged to increase defence spending and called on countries to join a ""coalition of the willing"" to deter Russia from further invading Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. He has committed the UK to putting boots on the ground and planes in the air to help maintain a peace. Moscow has criticised the idea of a foreign peacekeeping mission.",2025-03-10T09:59:39.649Z,Vicky Wong
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3z5z21zmo,Sinn Féin TD confirms he was questioned over financial issues,"A Sinn Féin member of the Dáil (Irish parliament) has confirmed that he has been questioned by gardaí (Irish police) over financial issues at a company where he previously worked. Thomas Gould, a TD for Cork North Central, has issued a statement saying he is innocent and ""utterly rejects"" claims being made against him. Gardaí have said a man was arrested in Cork ""as part of an ongoing investigation into fraud offences"" and later released without charge. Gould made a public statement after an earlier statement from the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald. In a statement on Saturday, McDonald said: ""In early February, Deputy Thomas Gould informed the party that a complaint had been made against him to the Gardaí and that he had been asked to make a statement on the matter. ""He was interviewed by Gardaí in Cork yesterday (Friday) and made a detailed statement to them. ""It is now for the Gardaí to continue their investigation into the complaint."" Gould's statement, issued through a solicitor, said he is ""entirely innocent"" and ""utterly rejects the complaint"" made against him by a former employer. He went on to say he was ""shocked and angry"" about the complaint, which he said relates to a period before he was elected to the Dáil in 2020. Gould said he is currently being treated for bowel cancer and ""proactively"" requested an early interview with Gardaí rather than wait until the treatment is concluded because of what he described as a ""serious attack"" on his reputation. He said he made a detailed statement, and he is confident his position will be vindicated. Gardaí say a man was arrested in County Cork on Friday as part of an ongoing investigation into fraud offences. The man, who was detained under Section 4 of the Irish Criminal Justice Act 1984, was released without charge later on Friday, according to Gardaí who say investigations are ongoing. In her statement, McDonald said a number of other people have been questioned as part of garda inquiries, including Sinn Féin councillor Kenneth Collins. The Cork City North West representative also worked at the same company and was questioned in January. ""They both emphatically deny the allegations,"" McDonald added. ""It is now for the gardaí to continue their investigation into the complaint."" A solicitor for Collins said he denies the allegations. In a statement reported by Irish broadcaster RTÉ, solicitor Frank Butimer said he accompanied his client to an appointment with detectives involved in the investigation in early January. Collins was then arrested, detained under section four of the Criminal Justice Act, and questioned for several hours by officers. ""He was made aware of the details of the allegations, which he hadn't heard before then,"" Mr Buttimer added. ""He fully co-operated with the garda enquiries and he denied any wrongdoing of any kind.""",2025-03-09T17:15:23.140Z,Kevin Sharkey

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpd573mxzo,Pair found guilty of murdering man thrown over cliffs,"A man and woman have been found guilty of murdering a 66-year-old man who was thrown over cliffs along the Wild Atlantic Way. Alan Vial, 39, of Drumanoo Head, Killybegs, County Donegal and Nikita Burns, 23, from An Charraig, County Donegal, both denied the murder of Robert Wilkin, who was also known as Robin, on 25 June 2023. The body of the County Tyrone man was found eight days later in the sea at the foot of Slieve League cliffs in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. It is not known if he was dead or alive when pushed. His body was found following a search involving gardaí (Irish police), the Donegal Mountain Rescue Team and the Irish Coastguard. The trial had previously heard Vial, Burns and Mr Wilkin had been drinking at various bars on the night of the murder. CCTV footage shown during the trial showed a car travelling from McIntyre's Bar in Dunkineely to Roshine, which a prosecutor said was most likely the place where Mr Wilkin was assaulted. The Irish state pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, had told the trial that she was unable to identify a cause of death due to the body's state of decomposition and the damage caused by the fall down the cliff face. However, she did identify two depressed fractures to the back of the victim's skull which were not consistent with a fall down a cliff. The prosecution case was that Mr Wilkin was beaten with a rock before being driven to Slieve League and put over the cliffs. Prosecutors also said the victim was either thrown over the cliff ""alive or dead"". They had argued that Burns and Vial acted together as a joint enterprise, meaning they were both equally responsible, regardless of who struck the fatal blow. During the trial, the two accused each other of the murder. The trial had been told that all three became friends just weeks before the murder and they had lived together at times in Vial's house in Killybegs. Vial and Burns had been in a brief relationship in the time leading up to the killing of Mr Wilkin. Vial, who was described by his barrister as ""a petty criminal and an alcoholic"", had pleaded not guilty to the murder. Burns, who the court heard had ""a difficult upbringing"", also pleaded not guilty to murder, but she pleaded guilty to impeding the apprehension or prosecution of another person for an arrestable offence. Mr Wilkin's body was discovered following a huge land, sea and air search along the County Donegal coastline involving search and rescue helicopters, boats, drones, the Irish defence forces, and a large number of people from local communities. The search began after a car in which the two killers were travelling crashed the evening after the victim was murdered and Vial was arrested for drink driving. The crash and Vial's arrest, along with admissions made by Burns to friends that evening, quickly led to a major police operation at the cliffs. After a lengthy trial which began in January, the jury took just over eight-and-a-half hours across three days to reach their verdicts. The seven women and five men found both Vial and Burns guilty of murder. Burns and Vial will both be sentenced on Friday.",2025-03-06T15:54:08.551Z,Kevin Sharkey
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mwllzzyxlo,Pelicots' daughter presses charges against father jailed in mass rape case,"Caroline Darian, the daughter of Dominique and Gisèle Pelicot, is pressing charges against her father, accusing him of drugging and raping her - something he has always denied. Last December, Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in jail for drugging his ex-wife, Gisèle, raping her and inviting dozens of men to also abuse her over nearly a decade. Pelicot filmed the rapes of his wife, collecting hundreds of videos he neatly catalogued on a hard disk. Among them were also two photos of his daughter, in which Ms Darian, 46, says she is clearly unconscious, sleeping in an unfamiliar position and wearing underwear she doesn't recognise. Dominique Pelicot has offered conflicting explanations for the photos, but has always denied sexually assaulting his daughter. Ms Darian has long said the photos are proof her father also drugged and raped her. ""I know that he drugged me, probably for sexual abuse. But I don't have any evidence,"" she told the BBC in January, when she also talked about the shock of being shown those pictures by police for the first time. Police will now launch an investigation, and prosecutors will later decide whether to proceed to trial. Béatrice Zavarro, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, told French media that Ms Darian's decision to press charges was ""unsurprising"". But she also pointed out that the prosecutors in the previous trial had said there were insufficient ""objective elements"" to accuse Pelicot of raping and using chemical submission on his daughter. The heated courtroom exchanges between Ms Darian and her father were some of the most dramatic in the 16-week trial that shocked France and the world. ""I never touched you, never,"" Pelicot pleaded to his daughter during one session. ""You are lying!"" Ms Darian shouted back. Ms Darian has previously said she felt she was the trial's ""forgotten victim"" as, unlike in her mother's case, there was no record of the abuse she is convinced was inflicted upon her. She told Elle France earlier this week that the charges she is pressing against her father were ""symbolic"" but ""in line with what I have said since the start: that I am a victim of chemical submission [drug-facilitated assault] but was never recognised as such"". She has hired lawyer Florence Rault to represent her. For many years, Ms Rault has been fighting for justice for two women who were the victims of violent ordeals in the 1990s. One, a young property agent known by the pseudonym Marion, was the victim of an attempted rape in 1999, to which Pelicot has admitted. The other - also an estate agent in her 20s - was raped and murdered in 1991. Pelicot is currently being investigated over that case, but has always denied any involvement. Ms Darian said she saw similarities between her and Marion. ""We look strangely alike. She is blonde, her hair is bobbed, we were born the same year... I wanted to meet her lawyer and hear all the details,"" she told Elle France. In her police complaint, which was quoted by French media, Ms Rault lamented that Ms Darian had never been offered gynecological examinations nor had she been tested for the drugs Pelicot used on his wife. Ms Rault said the investigation had only focused on Gisèle Pelicot and that her client had been treated as a ""peripheral victim"". She asked the authorities to launch a fresh ""serious and in-depth"" inquiry. Forty-nine men were sentenced in December alongside Dominque Pelicot. All were found guilty of at least one charge - rape or sexual assault - against Gisèle Pelicot. Seventeen initially said they would appeal the charges against them, but seven of those have since changed their minds. Those who decide to press ahead with their appeals will go on trial at the end of the year in Nîmes, southern France. The first trial - which lasted from September to December 2024 - garnered worldwide attention thanks to Gisèle Pelicot's decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",2025-03-06T15:00:10.036Z,Laura Gozzi

Speaking at an event on Wednesday, the prime minister said he hoped the evening would be an ""early celebration of everything Irish and everything that binds the UK and Ireland together"". The summit is the first of its kind, it will be attended by cabinet members from both the UK and Irish governments in Liverpool. It comes amid the backdrop of growing security concerns among the UK and EU countries about the influence of Russia. On Thursday, the prime minister and taoiseach will host a joint business roundtable with industry leaders and businesses across tech, finance, clean energy, manufacturing and construction from the UK and Ireland. The discussion will focus on potential opportunities for growth and investment, and how the UK and Ireland can work together to build an even more resilient and successful trading relationship. They will also discuss how both countries can work closer together on renewable energy, tech, AI and security. The two leaders are due to announce a new data sharing arrangement aimed at increasing the production offshore energy. As part of the summit, Ireland will also announce new investments into the UK worth £185.5 million, which the UK government say could create more than 2,500 jobs across the country. Ahead of the meeting, Martin paid tribute to the prime minister for ""his leadership over the last while"". ""He has been effective and impactful, we all want peace - there are too many wars in the world,"" he told reporters. Meanwhile, Sir Keir said: ""We can do much more when we work together with others and as I've said before, I don't believe that the relationship between the UK and Ireland has ever reached its full potential and I'm delighted that now, with this summit, we're going to change all of that. What an opportunity."" Asked if he would stand his ground with President Trump at events in Washington DC for St Patrick's Day next week, the taoiseach said his focus for now was the British-Irish relationship and that the Irish-US relationship remained important. He also said he did not agree with comments by First Minister Michelle O'Neill after she said she was ""incredulous"" at the UK Government's decision to spend up to £1.6bn on defence missiles for Ukraine. ""I wouldn't agree with the first minister - no one likes the utilisation of weapons and all my life I've been on the peace side of the equation,"" he said. ""We don't live in an ideal world, one has to have capability to defend your country. ""But it's Russia who illegally invaded Ukraine, that's the reality... Europe needs to improve and enhance its capability in order to have a deterrence to avoid any encroachment on a member of the EU."" Sir Keir has previously expressed the importance of ""resetting relation"" between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Last September, he became the first British prime minister to visit the Republic of Ireland in five years. Downing Street said the visit marked a ""new era of co-operation and friendship"" between Britain and Ireland. The summit is expected to finish by mid morning on Thursday as the taoiseach is attending a special European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday afternoon.",2025-03-05T22:34:14.792Z,Jayne McCormack
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5z8deg27xo,Serbia's opposition under fire for smoke and flare protest in parliament,"The cleaners had scrubbed the debating chamber clean before MPs arrived for Wednesday's session in Serbia's National Assembly. Spent smoke bombs, smears of egg yolk and a dusting of white fire extinguisher powder had all been removed from the benches and tables after the mayhem of the previous day. The police had also been on the scene. They were gathering evidence for potential criminal charges against the MPs who had plunged the parliament into a fug of pink and black smoke as they unfurled banners accusing the government of corruption. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic labelled the scenes ""hooliganism"". He said he was ""looking for responsibility, criminal law"" to be applied. Three female MPs were hurt. One of them was hit on the back of the head by an object, although it was unclear who threw it, and another apparently suffered a stroke. The EU said a parliament should be a place for democratic debate and that it was very concerned. Opposition party MPs were unabashed. The co-leader of the Green-Left Front, Radomir Lazovic, had let off a fire extinguisher from his seat in the chamber. He described the intervention as ""a response to the violence that has been perpetrated against the citizens of Serbia for 13 years"". That covers the period that the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has been in power. Under the leadership of Vucic - who previously served as deputy prime minister and prime minister - the party has been an election-winning machine. The SNS has emerged victorious from no fewer than five parliamentary elections since it first formed a governing coalition in 2012. Its opponents claim that has more to do with the party's domination of Serbia's media outlets and state institutions than its policies. But Vucic has successfully projected an image of strong, effective leadership that appeals to a large proportion of Serbia's electorate - particularly outside the main urban areas. He has weathered plenty of protest movements over the years. All of them have fizzled out without dislodging the president or his party. But the current series of rallies, demonstrations and blockades is presenting an unusually tricky challenge. The outpouring of outrage started with November's disaster at Novi Sad railway station - when a concrete canopy collapsed at the recently-renovated facility, killing 15 people. The station was part of the government's flagship infrastructure project - the high-speed railway linking the capital, Belgrade, to Budapest in Hungary. The fatal failure at such a high-profile site caused anguish and anger - and stoked suspicions that official corruption was behind the collapse. Students have been leading the calls for transparency and accountability, holding daily 15-minute vigils for the dead. But workers, ranging from lawyers to farmers, have also been staging strikes and blocking roads. ""Everyone has a reason to be unhappy,"" says analyst and journalist Bojan Elek. ""Terrible salaries, poor working conditions - everyone had something to add to the huge dissatisfaction that's in the population. ""But the students have been the key cohesive factor."" What the students have not been is political. They have kept opposition parties and NGOs away from their increasingly elaborate events, which have seen them take over the city centres of Novi Sad and Nis in recent weeks. Mr Elek describes this as ""a good move"" - but notes that ""at some point, politics will have to come into play"". What that might look like is not yet clear. Opposition parties are atomised - with no one single party capable of challenging the SNS, and an absence of a credible coalition. They have at least been united in their calls for the establishment of a technical government following the resignation of Prime Minister Milos Vucevic at the end of January. This could, they suggest, establish an electoral environment that would reduce the SNS's domination of the media and state bodies. Vucic has rejected that idea as an opposition attempt to overthrow a legitimately elected government. He may appoint a replacement prime minister or call fresh elections, even though the previous polls were held as recently as December 2023. Meanwhile, the protests continue. Students are promising their largest event yet in Belgrade on 15 March.",2025-03-05T19:45:20.417Z,Guy Delauney
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge8dnrge5o,Briton captured while fighting for Ukraine jailed in Russia,"A British man who was captured while fighting for Ukraine's armed forces has been jailed for 19 years by a Russian military court. James Scott Rhys Anderson was reportedly captured in Russia's Kursk region last November, where Ukraine had launched a cross-border incursion, and was charged with terrorism and mercenary activity. The 22-year-old is the first British national to be convicted by Russia during the war. The UK Foreign Office said Mr Anderson was sentenced on ""false charges"" and described him as a prisoner of war. A statement released by the Russian court claimed Mr Anderson had pleaded guilty but this cannot be verified, as he has not been heard from independently since he was taken. On Wednesday, a Russian military court ruled that Mr Anderson would spend the first five years of his sentence in prison before being transferred to a penal colony with ""strict"" conditions. Russian investigators had accused him of ""committing a terrorist act"" as part of an organised group, illegally crossing the border into Russia, causing ""significant damage to property"" and having ""destabilised"" the activities of authorities. But those claims were rejected by a UK Foreign Office spokesperson, who said they ""strongly condemn"" Mr Anderson's sentencing on ""false charges"". ""Under international law, prisoners of war cannot be prosecuted for participating in hostilities. ""We demand that Russia respect these obligations, including those under the Geneva Conventions, and stop using prisoners of war for political and propaganda purposes. ""We remain in close contact with Mr Anderson's family and are providing consular support."" Mr Anderson's three-day trial was held behind closed doors. Video footage released by the Kursk court showed Mr Anderson being led into court in handcuffs wearing a winter hat and jacket that appeared to be prison uniform. Reports of Mr Anderson's capture first came to light after a video circulated online showing a man identifying himself while being captured. In another video, he identified himself as a former British Army soldier from Oxfordshire. While Mr Anderson is the first UK citizen accused of fighting for Ukraine to be captured and convicted by Russia, two British captives were sentenced to death in Russia-occupied Donetsk - however, they were later released in a prisoner exchange.",2025-03-05T17:24:57.525Z,Emma Rossiter
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge1qq4jdxdo,Zelensky vows to 'make things right' with Trump and negotiate peace,"Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to work under Donald Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace days after their explosive Oval Office meeting. The Ukrainian president described the White House showdown as ""regrettable"" in a lengthy social media post in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. ""We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky – ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure – and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same,"" he wrote. ""Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal."" In his social media post, Zelensky said Friday's meeting ""did not go the way it was supposed to be"", adding: ""It is regrettable that it happened this way,"" he wrote. ""It is time to make things right. We would like future co-operation and communication to be constructive."" He also reiterated that Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US, after the failure to do so at the Washington meeting. Ukraine woke to the news on Tuesday that the US was ""pausing and reviewing"" its military aid to the country after a breakdown in diplomacy last week. In his post, Zelensky offered an overt declaration of gratitude for the help the US has so far given to his country. ""We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,"" he wrote. ""And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins. We are grateful for this,"" he added, referring to the US anti-tank missile system sold to Ukraine during Trump's first administration. During Friday's meeting in the Oval Office, Vice-President JD Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the military support the US had provided. ""Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting?"" Vance said, before Trump told Zelensky he was not being ""very thankful"". Zelensky defended himself in the meeting, and began an interview with Fox News in the hours afterwards, saying: ""I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support."" The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War III"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal – Trump told Zelensky ""come back when you're ready for peace"". Trump is due to deliver an address to Congress later on Tuesday, during which the Reuters news agency reports he plans to announce a minerals deal between US and Ukraine has been signed. A number of Ukraine's allies have commented on the latest from the Ukrainian president, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who welcomed Zelensky's ""steadfast commitment to securing peace"". It is ""vital that all parties worked towards a lasting and secure peace for Ukraine as soon as possible"", a statement from No 10 said. Likewise, French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky's willingness to ""re-engage in dialogue"" with Trump, the Elysee Palace said. Days before his meeting with Zelensky, the US President had met with Macron, who travelled to Washington with a warning to Trump: ""You can't be weak in the face of Putin."" While European leaders rallied behind Zelensky following the clash, Nato's secretary general advised the Ukrainian leader to ""find a way"" to restore his relationship with Trump. Speaking to the BBC the following day, Mark Rutte said he had told him ""we have to respect"" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far. Zelensky's statement falls short of an apology to Trump, which those in the US president's camp had called for. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin's team earlier welcomed the US's pause to military aid as likely to be the ""best"" contribution to peace. ""If the US stops, or pauses these supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg. Trump himself has not commented on the pause to aid, nor Zelensky's response, however he did earlier berate the Ukrainian leader following his meetings with European allies at the weekend. A Sunday summit - hosted by the UK prime minister - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was ""still very, very far away"". Trump described this as the ""worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky"", in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing,"" the president wrote.",2025-03-04T22:15:22.996Z,Jacqueline Howard

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmjk9mjnwmo,Pope Francis 'alert' after respiratory failure,"Pope Francis is alert after suffering two episodes of ""acute respiratory failure"" on Monday afternoon, the Vatican has said. Doctors were forced to intervene to clear mucus from the Pope's lungs, an update from the Holy See said, though it said he was alert throughout. The 88-year-old pontiff has resumed the use of an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing, but remains ""alert, focused and cooperative"", the Vatican said. This is now the third serious downturn since the 88-year-old pontiff was admitted to hospital 18 days ago with pneumonia. On Friday, Pope Francis suffered an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting, the Vatican said. Updates from the Holy See reported that he responded well to oxygen therapy, with Vatican officials saying on Sunday the Pope no longer required ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy"". Following Monday's episodes, Pope Francis has resumed that mechanical ventilation. His illness has meant that Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person for three weeks in a row, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead. Officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written ""in the past few days"". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care. He will also miss the procession and mass this Wednesday that mark the first day of Lent, the six-week period leading to Easter. Hundreds of Catholics gathered outside in St Peter's Square on Monday for an eighth evening to pray for the Pope's health, many carrying rosary beads as they headed across the cobbles towards the Basilica. The crowd, a mixture of priests and nuns based in Rome and Catholic pilgrims here for a Jubilee year, were led by an American cardinal. ""I come every night to pray, but this night I am pretty worried,"" Javier, a Romanian priest, voiced the feelings of many on the square. ""We still have hope, but it doesn't look good."" ""It looks bad, and that's a shame because we really like Francis,"" Patricia, a Spanish catholic from Toledo, told the BBC. She was following the prayers with her husband and young daughter. ""He's really opened the doors of the church to many, like LGBT people. I think they will look for a more conservative pope next, to stop the change."" Catholics have also been visiting the Gemelli hospital in Rome to pray for him - hoping he might come to the window, as has happened in the past. But although the Vatican recently described the Pope's condition as stable, he remains too sick even to greet the crowd below. The Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger.",2025-03-03T21:45:55.976Z,Sarah Rainsford
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0dkzrer18o,Trump condemns Zelensky remarks that war's end is 'far away',"A statement by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky saying a deal to end the war with Russia was ""very far away"" has drawn a furious response by Donald Trump. ""America will not put up with it for much longer,"" the US president said in a social media post, before accusing Zelensky of not wanting peace. A summit of mostly European leaders in London on Sunday agreed a four-point plan to guarantee Ukraine's defence in the event of a peace deal with Russia. ""Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?"" Trump said, apparently referring to the summit held two days after his fiery clash with Zelensky at the Oval Office. The summit - hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine and an attempt to reduce differences between Western countries over Ukraine. Britain and France said they were working on a European-led solution to the conflict. After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was ""still very, very far away"". He added that he expected the US to continue backing Ukraine despite his own fraught relations with Trump. ""I believe that Ukraine has a strong enough partnership with the United States of America,"" Zelensky said late on Sunday.  But on Monday, Trump responded by reiterating his view that Zelensky stood in the way of peace negotiations. ""This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer! It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing,"" he wrote on his Truth Social media network. During a news briefing later on Monday, Trump once again said that Zelensky ""should be more appreciative"" for the aid he has received from the US in the three years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. During the confrontation in front of cameras at the White House, both Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance expressed anger at what they perceived as Zelensky's lack of gratitude. ""Just say thank you,"" Vance demanded at one point.  The angry exchange meant that a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals was left unsigned. In his news conference on Monday, Trump said he did not believe the agreement was dead. He added that he would provide an update on the minerals deal late on Tuesday. After the London summit, the UK and France suggested a European ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - and to make sure Russia would not invade after a peace deal. Sir Keir said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have signalled they were open to the idea if it had the backing of the US. The European moves follow a reversal of US policy under President Trump. He says he wants to end the war and has held a lengthy telephone conversation with Putin and a round of talks with Moscow to which Ukraine was excluded. Trump has caused consternation among Western allies by saying he trusts Putin, accusing Zelensky of being a dictator and even saying Ukraine started the war, not Russia.",2025-03-03T21:24:13.729Z,Henri Astier
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1r4g08kwo,Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""",2025-03-03T20:51:46.932Z,James Landale

As the Ukrainian president arrived at the King's Norfolk residence, local residents, some holding Ukraine flags, gathered outside the estate to witness his entrance by helicopter. Zelensky was in London over the weekend for the talks on European defence, after a fiery exchange with US President Donald Trump in the White House on Friday. Ukraine's president was ""warmly received"", and the meeting lasted just under an hour, royal sources said. The pair were served tea in Sandringham's Saloon room. Zelensky described it as ""a very good meeting"". ""I'm very grateful for this meeting and for how His Majesty helps Ukraine and supports us,"" he told reporters. ""He's met our warriors here, being trained in the UK, and we're very thankful to the Royal Family for their support."" The King has previously expressed support for Zelensky and Ukraine, saying the country had experienced ""indescribable aggression"" following Russia's ""unprovoked attack on their land"". The Ukrainian people have shown ""truly remarkable courage and resilience in the face of such human tragedy"", the King said last year. They first met at Buckingham Palace during Zelensky's surprise visit to the UK in 2023, and the same day the King visited Ukrainian troops being trained in Wiltshire. Today's meeting was requested by the Ukrainian president, with the agreement of the UK government. After the summit had concluded, Sir Keir unveiled a four-step plan world leaders hope will guarantee peace in Ukraine. These steps include keeping military aid flowing and the creation of a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. Sunday's meeting in Norfolk has allowed Zelensky to meet the King well before Trump's second state visit to the UK, which was offered when Sir Keir presented the US president with an invitation letter from the monarch during a visit to Washington last week. While the Ukrainian leader's visit is an official one, it is less formal than a state visit. Traditionally, second-term US presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle. Sir Keir said Trump's last state visit in 2019 had been a ""tremendous success"" and that the invite for a second visit was ""truly historic"" and ""unprecedented"". Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office after reading the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an ""honour"" to visit the ""fantastic"" country. When the trip will take place has yet to be announced. Sir Keir dismissed calls by SNP first minister John Swinney to cancel the invite to Trump after his disastrous Oval Office meeting with Zelensky - in which he accused the Ukrainian leader of ""gambling with World War Three"".",2025-03-02T21:41:56.647Z,Tom McArthur
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn04551n6wpo,Was Starmer's summit enough to sway Trump?,"Lancaster House may have been bathed in sunshine as European leaders gathered to chart a way forward for Ukraine. But there was a cloud hanging over the summit amid the gilt-edged grandeur of the former royal townhouse in central London. It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine? The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US. He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's ""armed forces and border defences"" to ensure that ""Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,"" according to the official conclusions of the summit. And Sir Keir said there would be a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace. Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be ""a force consisting of European and other partners"". The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression. The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders"". The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop. The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace. Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly ""to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing"". This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky. The Europeans also wanted to find ways of repairing the transatlantic alliance, which is looking pretty fragile after the confrontation between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office on Friday. In recent weeks, the US administration has gone after its European allies; questioning their democracy, voting against them at the United Nations and - in the form of the president's chief enforcer, Elon Musk - saying even the US should leave the Nato military alliance. The summit in London was an attempt by the prime minister both to calm diplomatic brows and stiffen diplomatic sinews. Diplomats said there was clear resolve around the table to support Ukraine but also to build on Trump's desire to find a ceasefire. But Europe stepping up is only half of the story and much depends on whether the US is willing to play its part. Diplomats say the US is willing to de-escalate the tensions with Zelensky, but there were mixed messages on Sunday. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America was ready to engage with Ukraine, but the National Security Adviser Mike Waltz suggested Zelensky might have to resign as part of any ceasefire. So the outcome of the Lancaster House summit was seemingly a united European front in backing Zelensky, with the promise of more military support for Ukraine to come. But the cloud lurking in the London skies remains what the United States does next. And that is not yet clear. Trump and his deputy have made their antipathy towards Zelensky as clear as their trust in Putin.",2025-03-02T21:33:37.061Z,James Landale
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kgqdkx9jxo,Pope absent from St Peter's Square for third week,"For the third week in a row, Pope Francis has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person, with the Vatican publishing his written comments instead. Vatican officials said the text, sent from his hospital room in Rome, had been written ""in the past few days"". In it, the Pope thanked people for their prayers and thanked his medical team for their care. ""I feel in my heart the 'blessing' that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,"" he wrote. ""At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people."" The Pope usually makes his address from a window of the official Vatican appartments, drawing a crowd below on St Peter's Square. Many Catholics come specially for the chance to see him but this is now the longest Pope Francis has been out of the public eye since he was elected. Each evening on the square, a group of cardinals lead people in prayers for his health. In his latest written address, the Pope told Catholics that he felt their ""affection and closeness"" and felt ""carried and supported by all God's people"". The Vatican said he remained stable on Sunday, although doctors still describe his overall condition - with pneumonia - as ""complex"" and the risk of another infection is high. After 16 days in hospital, they are still giving no prognosis. The medical team has not spoken directly to journalists for over a week, and all updates are coming via Vatican officials. On Sunday, they said the Pope no longer required ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation, only high-flow oxygen therapy"". He does not have a fever and was able to participate in mass in a chapel on the 10th floor of Rome's Gemelli hospital where he is being treated. The Pope also received two visitors - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Parolin and his deputy Monsignor Pena Parra. They are the first to be mentioned by the Vatican in almost a week. There are no details about the length of time the men spent with him or what was discussed. The latest details do suggest that the Pope has rallied somewhat since Friday, when he suffered a second breathing ""crisis"" which doctors had worried might have a lasting impact. It was the second time the word ""crisis"" had been used since he was admitted to hospital on 14 February. By Sunday, though, Vatican sources were more reassuring. ""The Pope woke, had breakfast with coffee, continued his therapy and read the newspapers as he usually does,"" they told journalists. In his Sunday Angelus, the Pope prayed for peace, including in ""tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel"", adding: ""From here, war appears even more absurd."" Always outspoken against war, some of the Pope's previous comments on Ukraine have nevertheless created controversy. He suggested that Russia's full-scale invasion was ""somehow provoked"" and on one occasion agreed that Kyiv should show ""the courage of the white flag"" and negotiate for peace.",2025-03-02T21:24:21.427Z,Sarah Rainsford
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjenv29jgdo,Steve Rosenberg: Vladimir Putin can afford to sit back and watch events unfold,"Friday's drama in the Oval Office sparked a swift reaction from many world leaders. But not from Vladimir Putin. There's been no comment so far from the Kremlin leader. Then again, he doesn't really need to say anything. President Putin can afford to sit back and watch events unfold. Donald Trump predicted that the very public spat with President Zelensky was ""going to be great television"". There's little doubt that Vladimir Putin will have enjoyed the ""show"", the dramatic spectacle of Volodymyr Zelensky, leader of the country President Putin invaded, being berated by the president and vice-president of the United States in front of the world's media. Some Russian officials have commented, though, on events in Washington. In a post on social media, former president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of the Russian security council, wrote that President Zelensky had received ""a slap down in the Oval Office"". He called on the US to stop military assistance to Ukraine. How Moscow would welcome that. Writing on Telegram, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova praised Trump and JD Vance for their ""miracle of restraint"" at not hitting Ukraine's president. It's a sign of the new world in which we seem to be now that, while US-Ukraine relations are at risk of implosion, the opposite is true for US-Russia ties. In recent weeks, Trump and Putin have spoken on the phone and pledged to work closely together; there's talk of a possible summit sometime soon; lower-level US-Russia talks to reset relations and discuss potential economic cooperation have already started. President Putin has dangled the carrot of lucrative joint projects with the Americans involving rare earth minerals and aluminium production. The implications of a breakdown in relations between Ukraine and the US are potentially very serious for Kyiv, but very positive for Moscow. If the flow of American weapons to Ukraine were to stop, it would be much harder for Ukrainians to defend themselves against the Russian forces who have invaded their country, even if Ukraine enjoys solidarity and strong support from European leaders. For some time now, Moscow has believed that the war in Ukraine has been going Russia's way. The shouting-match in the Oval Office will have cemented that view.",2025-03-01T10:30:02.583Z,Steve Rosenberg
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj6787zzg79o,Colossal stakes for Starmer's summit on Ukraine,"In the immediate hours after those astonishing exchanges between Presidents Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky in the White House, European leaders, one after another, offered their public support for Ukraine. But the prime minister remained silent. Then, as I dashed into the studio for the BBC News at Ten, my phone went. I had been sent a statement from No 10: Sir Keir Starmer had spoken to them both and the prime minister ""retains unwavering support for Ukraine and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace"". Friday afternoon in the White House had not only entirely upended in the most spectacular fashion the relationship between two allies - America and Ukraine - but the diplomacy of recent days too, with the visits of President Emmanuel Macron of France and then the prime minister to the White House. Just 24 hours before Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the Oval Office, I had stood there in the same room witnessing Trump and Sir Keir's warmth and bonhomie: what a contrast to what was to come next. Sir Keir, like Emmanuel Macron before him, had sought to ingratiate himself with the wildly unpredictable American president, convinced that was the pragmatic course of action. Now the prime minister confronts a situation where two of the UK's allies are at loggerheads in the most public and angry way. Sources are tight-lipped about the precise nature of the two phone calls Sir Keir made on Friday night, very aware of the acute sensitivities of this delicate situation. But the UK's diplomatic efforts in recent weeks at least allowed those calls to be possible, allowing the UK to attempt to act as a bridge between both Kyiv and Washington, and Washington and Europe. It comes, though, at some political cost. The government's domestic critics such as the Scottish National Party argue that the invitation for Donald Trump to come to the UK on a second state visit should be rescinded. Sunday's summit of European leaders in London, hosted by the prime minister and attended by President Zelensky, was already shaping up to be crucial. It has now taken on further importance. To give you a sense of that, Trade Minister Douglas Alexander told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions that not only were the scenes in the Oval Office ""deeply troubling and sobering"" but demonstrated ""in the starkest possible terms"" the extent to which ""the world we've all experienced for the last 80 years"" had changed, adding we that were in ""uncharted waters"". He also called President Zelensky the ""bravest political leader in Europe since Winston Churchill"". And the European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said that it had ""become clear that the free world needs a new leader. It is up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge."" But that is the crux of this. Is Europe capable of that? At the heart of the UK and others' request of America is that the White House provides a security guarantee to Ukraine under any peace deal. The UK wants that to amount to air cover. This would be a big ask of any president at any time, with the danger of conflict escalating with Russia. But it is a colossal ask of a president who has made it abundantly clear he has no appetite whatsoever for American foreign military adventures. Which brings us to this weekend and President Zelensky joining his European allies in the UK. There is a colossal amount at stake.",2025-03-01T01:28:46.710Z,Chris Mason
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j0e7ye4m4o,Thousands of speeding fines quashed over camera error,"Almost 2,000 motorists in the Republic of Ireland are to have speeding fines and penalty points quashed. The decision has been taken because the speeding was detected by an uncertified speed camera. Some 1,871 drivers were caught speeding on the N17 in County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland between 20 December 2024 and 12 February 2025. They were all issued with fixed charge notices. The speeding was detected by a static speed safety camera system, and it is standard procedure for all cameras used for speeding detection to have valid calibration certificates issued by the GoSafe camera provider. Gardaí (Irish police) have explained that in conjunction with GoSafe they discovered that the camera, located near the town of Claremorris, was fully functional and accurately identifying offences, but it was not certified. This discovery was made on 12 February and the decision to quash fines and points was announced on Friday. Some of the motorists who were caught speeding on the busy road have already paid fines and they will now be refunded. A full breakdown of the figures shows that 800 notices were paid and penalty points applied while a further 123 fines were paid but the error was identified before these drivers were given penalty points. Garda Ch Supt Jane Humphries said ""this error is very much regretted"". However, she added: ""The level of speeding breaches issued since the camera went operational on December 20, 2024 demonstrates the continued need for all motorists using this road to slow down."" A spokesperson for the camera provider said: ""At GoSafe, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality and safety. During a routine quality assurance check, we identified that the calibration certificate for radar components in a static speed camera on the N17 in Mayo had expired."" ""To prevent a recurrence, we have implemented enhanced safeguards within our quality assurance process,"" the spokesperson added. Motorists impacted by error are now being notified by gardaí. The speed safety camera system went live on 20 December 2024. It was not operational between 1 January 2025 and 17 January 2025 as it had been vandalised. This means that all the 1,871 speeding notices were issued over a period of 39 operational days. The N17 became part of Irish folklore after an Irish band, The Saw Doctors, released a song of the same name around 1990. It was a nostalgic Irish emigration song at the height of mass emigration from the country and the band subsequently became hugely popular in Ireland and among Irish communities in the UK and US as well as in other parts of the world.",2025-02-28T17:19:56.316Z,Kevin Sharkey
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e44qev1dvo,Minister questions why Tate brothers were allowed to leave Romania,"Romania's Justice Minister Radu Marinescu has called for a public explanation into why controversial social media influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate were allowed to leave the country on Thursday. The brothers - who are currently facing charges including human trafficking in Romania - had been under a travel ban for more than two years before it was lifted, allowing them to fly to the US. Marinescu has asked the special prosecution service, Diicot, to ""conduct any investigation necessary to uncover the truth promptly, correctly, and impartially"". Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The brothers are dual US-UK citizens, and were first arrested in Romania in 2022, where they are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They spent several months under house arrest in Romania, before prosecutors announced on Thursday that the travel ban had been lifted and the pair's US passports had been returned to them. Despite this, investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. On Friday, four British women who have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control urged the UK government to ""immediately request Tate's extradition from the US to the UK to face justice"". They said in a joint statement that if it did not, ""it won't just be us it will be failing, but all British victims of alleged sexual violence"". They added: ""We do not doubt the home secretary's personal commitment to victims of sexual violence, but we need action, not words."" The brothers' exit has sparked concerns that Romanian prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. On Thursday, the US president said he knew nothing about their release. Romania's justice minister said the Tate brothers ""risk pre-trial detention"" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. But international human rights lawyer Silvia Tabusca, who has been following the proceedings, does not believe the brothers will return to Romania. She told the BBC Andrew Tate was ""technically correct"" when, upon arriving in Florida, he said there was no live indictment against him and his brother, because a second case has not yet been presented to a judge. In December 2024, the Court of Appeals in Bucharest ruled that an original indictment - the first case - which was issued in June 2023 could not proceed to trial in its current form. In August, Romanian authorities began a second investigation over new allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. When both cases have been submitted to the court, they will become live. ""It's actually a sort of lull in the two cases against them,"" Ms Tabusca explained. ""A big question mark hangs over whether they will ever return there to face trial, what the US government would do in such a situation, and what pressure the UK government is putting on the US to extradite them to the UK to face trial on another set of charges there."" Romania's justice minister said the Tate brothers ""risk pre-trial detention"" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. ""There are legal mechanisms in place to resolve this situation,"" Marinescu said, which could be a reference to the extradition treaty between the US and Romania. Calls for a public explanation of why their travel ban was lifted comes as many Romanians express concern that there appears to be one law for the rich and influential, and another for ordinary citizens.",2025-02-28T15:57:24.153Z,Nick Thorpe &
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kggxm6gevo,Dáil speaking rights protest branded 'childish',"Irish opposition parties have been branded ""childish"" by the tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) after they announced protest action over a long-running row on speaking rights at the Irish parliament. The issue, sparked in January when Ireland's newly-formed coalition government attempted to be formally elected, centres on independent members of the government getting dedicated time in parliament to hold ministers to account. On Thursday, a Dáil (Irish parliament) reform committee voted to allow new speaking slots for those independent members who support the government. However, opposition parties labelled the meeting as ""disgraceful"". The parties - including Sinn Féin, Labour, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and Independent Ireland - have announced they will withdraw from pairing arrangements in protest. The speaking rights plan has to be voted through the Dáil before it can proceed but will have sufficient support thanks to the government majority. Pairing is a process where a parliament member of a party abstains from a vote if the member of an opposition party cannot attend. The withdrawal of pairing would negatively affect government business in March when most ministers travel abroad for St Patrick's Day engagements. Almost 40 ministers, junior ministers and other state officials have trips organised to destinations including the US, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Thailand. Tánaiste Simon Harris told the Dáil it has never been more important for ministers to travel abroad for discussions, but the withdrawal of pairings will now prevent this. He also defended the government's speaking rights plan, arguing that all Dáil members should be allowed ask questions on behalf of their constituents. But he faced pointed questions from opposition members about what kind of deal the government had done with independents in order to secure their support. The government is seeking to push through a plan to introduce extra speaking time slots in the Dáil for independents who want to question the country's leaders. Some of those independents supported and even helped to negotiate the current programme for government. However, they now want dedicated Dáil time to hold ministers to account, something that opposition parties argue would undermine democracy. The row has been rumbling since January, when loud protests from opposition parties led to turbulent scenes in the Dáil, which had to be repeatedly adjourned. The protests resulted in a one-day delay to the re-election of Micheál Martin as taoiseach (Irish prime minister). In early February, the Ceann Comhairle (parliament speaker) ruled the initial plan - which would have seen those independents treated as part of the opposition for the purposes of speaking time - could not proceed. On Wednesday, the Dáil Reform Committee voted to approve a plan that would see the creation of new question time slots for independent members. Irish national broadcaster RTÉ reported that the government defended the plan in a two-page document circulated to the Dáil Reform Committee, which started a ""modern parliament is not necessarily made up of 'government' and 'opposition' members"". It added ""there are members who can't readily be categorised as such,"" referring to independents who support the government but do not have ministerial posts. It has also said the plan would mean independents have their own speaking time that would not take away from opposition speaking time rights. If voted through, the plan would mean about 60 Dáil members would be allowed to question the taoiseach and the tánaiste on a weekly basis. Harris argued on Thursday that all TDs (Irish parliament members) should be allowed to ask questions on behalf of their constituents and he vowed to defend that right. However opposition parties have been highly critical - in a joint statement they said it was ""another cynical attempt to manipulate speaking time in order to grant special privileges to TDs who were part of negotiating the programme for government and clearly and unambiguously support the government"". Sinn Féin's Matt Carthy said the government was plunging the Dáil into chaos while Labour TD Duncan Smith said the government were ""defending the indefensible"". Martin's Fianna Fáil party won the most seats in November's general election but not enough to form a government on their own. It entered a coalition with Fine Gael and several independents to gain a majority, but some of those independents sought to form a ""technical group"" that would have seen them afforded speaking time and other rights from the opposition benches.",2025-02-27T18:05:27.027Z,N/A
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjj9lv5qvo,Murder trial judge tells jury to 'proceed with caution',"Jurors in the trial of two people accused of the murder of 66-year-old Robert Wilkin have been warned it could be dangerous to act on some of the testimony of one of the co-accused. Alan Vial, 39, of Drumanoo Head, Killybegs, County Donegal, and Nikita Burns, 23, from An Charraig, County Donegal, both deny the murder of Robert Wilkin, who was also known as Robin, on 25 June 2023. The body of the County Tyrone man was found in the sea at the foot of Slieve League cliffs in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. On Thursday, Mr Justice Paul McDermott urged the jury to ""proceed with caution"" in respect of Mr Vial's evidence ""in respect of his implication of Ms Burns."" During the trial Mr Vial claimed it was his former lover and co-accused Ms Burns who beat Mr Wilkin to death with a rock and helped put his body over Ireland's tallest cliffs. He insisted he was telling the truth when he said that Ms Burns caused Mr Wilkin's death by twice striking him on the back of the head with a rock and that he did not strike him at all. It is the prosecution case that Mr Vial and Ms Burns were part of a joint enterprise to cause serious harm to Mr Wilkin before putting him over the cliffs. In a statement to Gardai ( Irish police), Ms Burns denied striking Mr Wilkin and described a fight in which her co-accused hit the deceased six or seven times with a rock. She also denied helping to put the body over the cliff but accepted that she had helped to clean Mr Wilkin's blood from the car. Mr Justice McDermott told the jury at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin that Ms Burns' statements to Gardai or others outside court cannot be used as evidence against Mr Vial. However, Mr Vial's court testimony, which was subject to cross examination by Ms Burns' lawyers, can be used as evidence against her. The judge added: ""You have to proceed with caution when considering his evidence in respect of his implication of Ms Burns, because there is a danger that a co-accused, in his position, on the same charge of murder, may fabricate evidence or falsely implicate their co-accused."" While the jury can rely on Mr Vial's testimony if they accept it, Mr Justice McDermott said it is ""dangerous to act on it"" where it is uncorroborated by other evidence. ""You are not precluded from acting on it,"" he said, ""but you must bear in mind the warning I have given you in respect of doing so."" Jurors were told where the prosecution alleges a joint enterprise murder, it must prove that both accused entered a tacit or explicit agreement to kill or cause serious injury to Mr Wilkin. If they both acted in pursuit of that joint goal, the prosecution does not have to establish which of the two inflicted the fatal blows. However, if the prosecution has failed to prove the joint enterprise beyond a reasonable doubt, jurors were told, they must consider each accused's individual responsibility. In particular, they must consider whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt whether either accused killed Mr Wilkin with the necessary intent for murder. The judge further told the jury that in relation to each accused, they can return a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of impeding the apprehension of another person for murder. That would arise, he said, in a situation where they were satisfied that one of the accused is guilty of murder but the case against the other is unproven. Mr Justice McDermott has begun a reprise of the evidence heard during the trial, which began on 17 January. The jury is not available on Friday or Monday and will return next Tuesday.",2025-02-27T17:55:40.999Z,N/A
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e774zkeg6o,Taoiseach 'committed' to helping Ukraine financially,"The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin has told the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky that Ireland is committed to helping his country financially. They met at Shannon Airport in County Clare on Thursday. Martin cancelled a planned visit to Stormont in order to attend the meeting. He told Zelensky that he has to look at ""alternative approaches to give financial aid to Ukraine"". ""Our commitments... have been frustrated by Hungary's decision to veto the deployment of the European peace facility fund set up by the European union,"" he explained. Zelensky is due to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources. He made a brief stop at the Irish airport on the way to this meeting. ""We discussed issues around a sustainable and durable peace settlement,"" Martin said. ""We made it clear that we would push very strongly for an accelerated timeline in terms of Ukrainian membership of the European Union,"" he said. He said Zelensky ""was very thankful... for Ireland's sustained support for the Ukrainian people... as they battle through this terrible war"". He said Ireland could help by taking part in initiatives to help feed children in Ukraine and is looking into supporting financially the use of robotic drones to help bring back soldiers who are injured. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that Zelensky said he was delighted to be in Ireland and to meet with the Taoiseach. He thanked the Irish people for the support they have offered Ukrainian citizens who have been forced to flee from conflict. At the end of 2024 almost 80,000 Ukrainian refugees were still living in the Republic of Ireland, according to Ireland's Central Statistics Office. Earlier this week, Ireland pledged to increase financial humanitarian aid to Ukraine.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39v779xpdno,Carney talks tough on Trump threat - but can he reset relations?,"Mark Carney's thumping victory in the race to succeed Justin Trudeau makes him not only leader of the Liberal Party but, by default, the next Canadian prime minister. It's an extraordinary result for a man with very little political experience. He has never been elected as an MP, let alone served in a cabinet post. What Carney does have though - as Governor of the Bank of Canada during the global financial crisis and Governor of the Bank of England during the Brexit negotiations - is a long track record in global finance during times of economic turbulence. And at a moment like this, Carney has been arguing, that could prove invaluable. Politics in this country has been turned on its head as a result of what's happening south of the border, with US President Donald Trump launching a trade war and threatening to make Canada the 51st state of America. Addressing a crowd of Liberal supporters after the result of the leadership contest was announced on Sunday evening, Carney promised to face down the threats from Trump, over the tariffs and the claims on Canada's sovereignty. ""Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape or form,"" he said. ""We didn't ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. ""Americans should make no mistake"", he warned. ""In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win."" He repeatedly referred to the US president by name and said his government would keep retaliatory tariffs in place until ""America shows us respect"". How he will translate his strong language on the stage in Ottawa into practical solutions to those twin challenges was, however, far less clear. Liberals might hope that Trudeau's exit from the stage will, in itself, help clear the air. Instead of the frequent mocking of Trudeau by Trump as a ""weak"" leader, they might dare to believe that Carney will at least be able to reset the personal chemistry. On the other hand, if he has to push hard in an attempt to win concessions, will he also risk incurring the wrath of a man who uses unpredictability as a political art form? Much of that will depend on how serious the US president is in his insistence that he wants to impose real economic pain on Canada and annex its territory. And that's a hard question to answer. After Carney had accepted the party's nomination, I caught up with former Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, who served for a decade from 1993 and who'd taken to the stage earlier in the evening. Did he think Trump was being serious? ""You know, I don't know,"" he told me. ""Do you know? Does anyone know? I'm not a medical doctor or a psychiatrist. He changes his mind every two or three hours. So [for him] to be leader of the free world, it is preoccupying for everybody."" While the US threat is dominating Canadian politics - Carney described the current situation as ""dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust"" - there are still domestic political matters to focus on too, not least the prospect of a general election. Once sworn in as prime minister in the coming days, Carney will have to decide whether to call a snap election. If he doesn't, the opposition parties in parliament could force one later this month through a no-confidence vote. Before Trudeau said he was stepping down, the Liberal Party was facing electoral oblivion. After nine years in power, he'd become a liability and a lightning rod for public anger over the rising cost of living despite record levels of government spending and a ballooning national debt. The stage appeared to be set for the Liberals to be swept from power by a Conservative Party under the stewardship of the young, populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who had turned lambasting Trudeau into something of a sport. Now, not only has he lost the advantage of a deeply unpopular opponent, his political style is at risk of appearing out of step. In the current environment, even a loose alignment with the politics of Trump is a potential liability with Canadian voters. The Republican president, for his part, recently said Canada's Conservative leader was not Maga enough. The Liberal Party is suddenly feeling a sense of rejuvenation - the gap in the opinion polls with the Conservatives, once a gulf, has narrowed dramatically. And you could feel that palpable sense of optimism in the room on Sunday evening. Aware of the danger, Poilievre accused Liberals of ""trying to trick Canadians"" to elect them to a fourth term. But his statement also highlighted how Trump is changing the political messaging on this side of the border. ""It is the same Liberal team that drove up taxes, housing costs, and food prices, while Carney personally profited from moving billions of dollars and thousands of jobs out of Canada to the United States,"" Poilievre wrote. ""We need a new Conservative government that will put Canada First - for a change."" Trump's election has led Canada to rally to round its flag and has propelled a former central bank governor – an archetypal member of the country's political elite – to the highest office in the land. The Conservatives may still lead in the polls, but for the first time in a long time, the Liberals believe that, under Carney, they have a fighting chance again.",2025-03-10T02:50:18.646Z,John Sudworth
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9dp5rr2x9o,US says Ukraine 'ready to move forward' on truce demand,"The Trump administration believes Ukraine's leadership is ""ready to move forward"" with the US's demand for a ceasefire process with Russia, according to a senior US state department official. The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz are due to arrive in Saudi Arabia for Tuesday's talks with their Ukrainian counterparts. US President Donald Trump has stepped up pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to accept his demands for a quick ceasefire with Moscow - but without any immediate pledge of a US security guarantee. Ten days ago the two publicly clashed at the White House, with Trump claiming Zelensky was not ready to end the fighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. ""The fact that they're coming here at senior levels is a good indication to us that they want to sit down and they're ready to move forward,"" said the state department official, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the talks with Ukraine in Jeddah. While Zelensky is also due in the Gulf kingdom to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the former is not expected to play any formal role in the talks with the Americans. The Ukrainian team will be represented by Zelensky's head of office Andriy Yermak, the country's national security adviser as well as foreign and defence ministers. Zelensky wrote on social media on Monday that Ukraine ""has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason that the war is continuing is because of Russia"". A short while later, during a daily briefing, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that it was important to determine whether Ukraine really wanted peace or not. Zelensky has on numerous occasions been accused by US officials of not wanting peace. The Ukrainian leader has been under strong US pressure to make concessions ahead of any peace talks, while he has been pushing for firm security guarantees for Kyiv, stressing that Putin violated previous ceasefire deals. On Friday, Trump issued a rare threat of further sanctions against Moscow in a push for a deal. Russia is already heavily sanctioned by the US over the war. Trump said he was contemplating the move because ""Russia is absolutely 'pounding' Ukraine on the battlefield right now"". Soon after the White House row, Zelensky expressed regret about the incident and tried to repair relations with the US - the country's biggest military supplier. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, later said that Trump had received a letter from Zelensky that included an ""apology"" and ""sense of gratitude"". Witkoff said that in Saudi Arabia the US team wanted to discuss a ""framework"" for peace to try to end the Russia-Ukraine war. A major minerals deal - derailed because of the row - is also reported to be back on the agenda in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine has offered to grant the US access to its rare earth mineral reserves in exchange for US security guarantees. Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko said he believed Zelensky needed to secure the US-Ukraine relationship ""at any cost"" during his trip to Saudi Arabia, while making clear ""what our red lines are"". ""Otherwise, if there is a deal outside of these terms, then we will just say no, that's all. Because it's our army fighting,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The clash at the White House also resulted in the US pausing all military aid to Ukraine and stopping sharing intelligence. But when asked on Sunday whether he would consider lifting the intelligence pause, Trump answered: ""Well, we just about have. I mean, we really just about have and we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done."" He provided no further details. On 18 February - before the US-Ukraine row in Washington - Rubio held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Saudi Arabia. It was a follow-up to Trump's controversial phone conversation with Putin. The comments come as the Ukrainian military said that it shot down 130 Russian drones overnight. Over the weekend, a wave of Russian drone strikes killed at least 25 people - mainly in the eastern Donetsk town of Dobropillya. Elsewhere, Russian forces are reportedly trying to encircle thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in the Kursk region after recapturing three settlements on Sunday. It comes seven months after a cross-border assault that Kyiv launched in part to gain a bargaining chip in possible peace negotiations. Reports from Russian bloggers say Moscow special forces had crept for miles through a gas pipeline near the town of Sudzha in an attempt to surprise Ukrainian forces. Also on Monday, the Ukraine's Ministry of Defence said it will purchase 4.5 million Ukrainian-made drones in 2025, at a cost of more than £2bn.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q1pl1eldno,"Pro-Palestinian student protester detained by US immigration officials, says lawyer","A student who played a prominent role during pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University in New York City last year has been detained by federal immigration officials, says his lawyer. Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian refugee raised in Syria, was lead student negotiator for the encampment at the campus on the west side of Manhattan. His attorney, Amy Greer, told the BBC that Mr Khalil was inside his university-owned home when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents took him into custody on Saturday. Columbia was the epicentre last year of pro-Palestinian student protests nationwide against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel. The BBC contacted the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State and Columbia University on Sunday for comment. Secretary of State Marco Rubio later posted a news story on X about the arrest of Mr Khalil, commenting: ""We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported"". Ms Greer said the ICE agents told Mr Khalil his student visa had been revoked, but she said her client is a legal permanent resident with a green card and married to an American citizen. ""Initially we were informed this morning that he had been transferred to an ICE facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey,"" Ms Greer said. ""However, when his wife – a US citizen who is eight months' pregnant and was threatened with arrest as well by the ICE agents last night – tried to visit him there today, she was told he is not detained there."" She said she is unaware of Mr Khalil's current location, although an online detainee locator search on the ICE website indicates a Syrian-born individual named Mahmoud Khalil was being held at the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility in New Jersey. Ms Greer said they had heard that Mr Khalil could be transferred as far away as Louisiana, without adding details. The lawyer said what happened to her client is a ""terrible and inexcusable – and calculated – wrong"". During the protests last summer, Mr Khalil said he was leading negotiations with university administrators on behalf of the student protesters. They had set up a huge tent encampment on the university lawn in protest against the Gaza war. Some students also seized control of an academic building for several hours before police entered the campus to arrest them. Mr Khalil was not in that group. He later told the BBC he had been temporarily suspended by the university, where he is a graduate student at the School of International and Public Affairs. Mr Khalil's detention follows US President Donald Trump's executive order in January warning anyone involved in ""pro-jihadist protests"" and ""all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses"" would be deported. Some Jewish students at Columbia have said that rhetoric at the demonstrations at times crossed the line into antisemitism. Other Jewish students on campus have joined the pro-Palestinian protests. In a thread on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association said it welcomed reports suggesting Mr Khalil's green card would be revoked, describing him as ""a ringleader of the chaos"" at Columbia. The Trump administration last week announced it was revoking $400m (£310m) in federal grants to Columbia, accusing it of failing to fight antisemitism on campus. Columbia interim president Katrina Armstrong said in a campus-wide email on Friday that ""the cancellation of these funds will immediately impact research and other critical functions of the University"". The Israeli military launched its campaign against Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack into Israel on 7 October 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage. More than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2025-03-10T03:07:46.397Z,Nomia Iqbal
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87vg38dnpo,Musk and Rubio spar with Polish minister over Starlink in Ukraine,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk have clashed with Poland's foreign minister over the use of the tech billionaire's Starlink satellite internet system in Ukraine. Musk said on X that Ukraine's ""entire front line"" would collapse if he turned the system off. Radoslaw Sikorski responded, saying his country paid for its use in Ukraine and a threat to shut it down would result in a search for another network. Rubio dismissed Sikorski's claims and told him to be grateful, while Musk called him a ""small man"". The exchange appeared to lead to Polish PM Donald Tusk calling on his country's allies to show respect for their weaker partners, rather than arrogance. Starlink's system is part of SpaceX's venture to provide high-speed internet to remote and underserved areas. It has been used extensively by the Ukrainian military. Sunday's exchange started when Musk posted that Starlink was the ""backbone of the Ukrainian army"" and that ""their entire front line would collapse if I turned it off"". Sikorski then responded, saying that Poland was paying for the service. ""Starlinks for Ukraine are paid for by the Polish Digitization Ministry at the cost of about $50 million per year,"" Sikorski wrote. ""The ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers."" In response, Rubio said Sikorski was ""just making things up... no-one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink"". ""And say thank you because without Starlink Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,"" he added. Musk later responded to Sikorski's post calling him a ""small man"". ""Be quiet, small man. You pay a tiny fraction of the cost. And there is no substitute for Starlink,"" he wrote. On Monday morning Polish Prime Minister Tusk, without specifying who or what he was referring to, wrote on X: ""True leadership means respect for partners and allies. ""Even for the smaller and weaker ones. Never arrogance. Dear friends, think about it."" The Starlink terminals are key to Ukraine's army operations and have been used since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022. There are tens of thousands of terminals in the country, including up to 500 bought by the US Department of Defence in June 2023. Starlink provides internet connection enabling Ukrainian troops to observe what's happening on the frontline. Each military unit has a base where they receive a video stream from reconnaissance drones. Monitoring the battleground in real time compensates for the shortage of troops. The Ukrainian Army does not need to keep large forces along the entire area they defend because they will know when Russian troops launch an attack and can quickly react by striking that area with artillery and other weapons. Video streams from drones also help to direct artillery fire and identify targets for kamikaze drones. They are the eyes of the Ukrainian troops, without which their lack of weapons and ammunition in would have catastrophic consequences. Starlink provides one of, if not the most, reliable means of communication. Without it requesting evacuation or providing the exact location of a target would be much slower and more complicated as regular radio stations may be out of range, jammed or compromised.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydlr3reqpo,A simple guide to Canada's federal election,"Mark Carney is due to be sworn in as Canada's next prime minister in the coming days, having won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau. It means he will lead the governing Liberal Party of Canada in the next election - which is expected to be called soon. Several political leaders had called for a vote after Trudeau announced he was resigning as leader of the Liberals in January. But after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on the country, potentially sparking a trade war, opposition parties have suggested Canada should vote as soon as possible. By law, the maximum time between federal elections in Canada is five years. The next vote is officially scheduled for 20 October 2025. However, there are a couple of scenarios in which an early election can be triggered: When Trudeau resigned in January, he suspended parliament so that the Liberal Party, which currently controls government, could have a leadership race to find his replacement. Carney, announced as Trudeau's replacement on Sunday, could call an election early. Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, has already said he will call for a vote of no confidence once parliament returns, as has Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party. In the Canadian federal election - as in the UK's general election - voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister. Instead, it is the leader of the party with the majority of members of parliament (MPs) who becomes PM. That means Carney will be in the running, along with Poilievre and Singh. Four main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois. The Liberals have been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. They currently hold 153 seats. The Conservatives are the official opposition with 120 seats. The Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, has 33 seats, and the NDP has 24. The Green Party hold two seats. During the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead. But the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down. Trump has since taken office in the US and introduced steep tariffs against Canada, which has raised expectations of a closer vote. When Trudeau resigned at the beginning of this year, he did so under significant pressure from his own party - it was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the party's hopes of winning the next election. National polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), show how support for the Liberals waned throughout 2023 and 2024. At the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January of this year - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%. Since then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that 40.4% of Canadians back the Conservatives, while 30.8% support the Liberals. In the process of regaining some support, the Liberals have attempted to draw comparisons between Poilievre and Trump in the aftermath of the US president introducing 25% tariffs on all Canadian imports to the country. After being announced as Trudeau's successor, Carney said regarding the trade war that ""Americans should make no mistake... Canada will win"". There are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons. All the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election. Members of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election. Like the UK, Canada has a ""first-past-the-post"" electoral system. The candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area. The leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs will normally form the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition. If no party ends up with a majority seats - the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government. Practically, it means the party will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties. To vote in a Canadian election, someone must be a Canadian citizen, at least 18 years old, and have proof of identity and address.",2025-03-10T09:00:05.476Z,N/A
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz61nn99eg1o,Trump says US economy in 'transition' as trade war escalates,"US President Donald Trump has refused to say whether the US economy is facing a recession or price rises in the wake of his administration's changes to tariff threats against some of its closest trading partners. Asked if he was expecting a recession this year, Trump said there was a ""period of transition"" taking place. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, however, insisted there would be no contraction in the world's largest economy, while acknowledging that the price of some goods may rise. It comes after a volatile week for US financial markets as investors grappled with uncertainty from his administration's U-turn on some key parts of its aggressive trade policies. New tit-for-tat tariffs from China, which target some US farm products, came into effect on Monday. Speaking to Fox News in an interview broadcast on Sunday but recorded on Thursday, Trump responded to a question about a recession: ""I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing."" ""It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us,"" he added. Last week, the US imposed new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada but then exempted many of those goods just two days later. Trump also doubled a blanket tariff on goods from China to 20%. In response, Beijing announced retaliatory taxes on some imports of agricultural goods from the US. From today, certain US farm products going into China - including chicken, beef, pork, wheat, and soybeans - face new tariffs of 10 to 15%. Han Shen Lin, China country director at consultancy firm The Asia Group, told the BBC's Today programme: ""You're seeing a lot of tit for tat between both sides to demonstrate that neither side will back off easily. ""That said China has realised it probably can't export its way to GDP growth in the way that it used to so it is focusing a lot more on the domestic economy right now."" The US president has accused China, Mexico and Canada of not doing enough to end the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the US. The three countries have rejected the accusations. Stocks on Wall Street have fallen since Trump sparked a trade war with the US's top trading partners. Investors fear tariffs will lead to higher prices and ultimately dent growth in the world's largest economy. Speaking on NBC on Sunday, Lutnick said: ""Foreign goods may get a little more expensive. But American goods are going to get cheaper"". But when asked whether the US economy could face a recession Lutnick added: ""Absolutely not… There's going to be no recession in America."" Former US Commerce Department official, Frank Lavin, told the BBC that he thinks the trade war is unlikely to escalate out of control. Tariffs will eventually ""fade a bit"" but still be an ""extra burden on the US economy,"" he said. Rachel Winter, investment manager at Killik & Co, told the Today programme she thought the US was likely to have a period of higher inflation. ""Tariffs are theoretically inflationary and the level of tariffs that Trump is imposing, I think no doubt, will have to cause inflation somewhere down the line,"" she said.",2025-03-10T07:58:54.529Z,João da Silva

President Donald Trump was not in the White House at the time, as he is spending the weekend at his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80ygg9yzrmo,Three suspects at large after 12 injured in Toronto pub shooting,"Three suspects are still at large after 12 people were injured in a shooting at a pub in Toronto, police in the Canadian city say. The shooting took place at 22:39 on Friday local time (03:39 GMT Saturday) near Scarborough city centre in eastern Toronto. Authorities said six people suffered bullet wounds and others were hurt by flying or broken glass. The injuries were not life-threatening, they said. Toronto police said the three men, armed with an assault rifle and handguns, had entered the pub and ""opened fire indiscriminately"". A motive ""right now remains unclear and we're chasing down all leads"", said Police Supt Paul MacIntyre. ""This was a brazen and reckless act of violence that's really shaken our community and the city itself,"" he added. Police said they were deploying all available resources to find the suspects. Earlier, they said that one suspect, wearing a black balaclava, had been seen fleeing the scene in a silver car. The victims ranged in age from 20s to mid-50, according to police. ""I'm happy to report, by the grace of God, that there have been no fatalities,"" Supt MacIntyre said, which he called ""extremely lucky."" He said he and other officers were ""horrified"" by video of the shooting. ""These guys just looked at the crowd and opened fire. It was horrible."" Glass walls were shattered and there was ""blood all over the floor"", including in the basement, where some people ran to hide before police arrived, he said. Mayor Olivia Chow expressed deep concern over the mass shooting, telling reporters on Saturday that she was ""deeply troubled"" by the incident. ""It is troubling because of the magnitude of the shooting and the number of people hurt,"" Mayor Chow said. She said that police have been actively investigating the case throughout the night and into the morning. Ontario Premier Doug Ford also condemned the violence, stating in an X post on Saturday that he fully supports the Toronto Police Service in their search for the suspects. The number of those injured in this incident is high compared to other shootings in the area in 2024. Last year, eight people were injured and two killed in shootings and firearm discharges in the police division where Friday's incident occurred, the department's data shows. In Toronto, which has a three million population, 43 people were killed in shootings last year. Canada has a lower rate of firearm homicides than its neighbour the US, with 0.6 per 100,000 people compared to 4.5 per 100,000, according to 2021 data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.",2025-03-08T18:04:37.294Z,Mallory Moench
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwd1722yr2o,Is Trump reining in Musk after a cabinet showdown with secretaries?,"US President Donald Trump called a meeting of his cabinet secretaries on Thursday to discuss Elon Musk and his efforts to slash government spending and personnel numbers. It turned heated, according to media reports. Musk accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of failing to cut enough staff at the state department, reports the New York Times. The tech mogul told Rubio he was ""good on TV"", according to the newspaper, pointedly skipping any praise of his work as America's top diplomat. The billionaire also clashed with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over whether Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) task force had tried to lay off air traffic controllers who were already in short supply in the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the New York Times. Duffy's department has been under scrutiny after two US airline crashes since Trump took office in January. After listening to the back-and-forth, the Republican president reportedly intervened to make clear he still supported Doge, but from now on cabinet secretaries would be in charge and the Musk team would only advise. A state department spokeswoman told the newspaper Rubio felt the cabinet meeting was an ""open and productive discussion"". The White House has not responded to BBC requests for further comment. Speaking in the Oval Office after the meeting, Trump said cabinet members should decide who to cut, but if they didn't, Musk would do the job. ""I had a meeting, and I said I want the cabinet members to go first"", Trump said. ""And if they can cut it's better, if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting."" The hastily planned gathering could provide evidence that the president has decided to curtail the sweeping power the SpaceX and Tesla boss and his Doge cost-cutting initiative have commanded in the early weeks of his administration. Trump first commented on the substance of Thursday's meeting, which was disclosed only in after-the-fact media reports, through a post that evening on his social media site, Truth Social. He said that he had instructed his secretaries to work with Doge on ""cost-cutting measures"". ""As the secretaries learn about, and understand, the people working for the various departments, they can be very precise as to who will remain, and who will go,"" he wrote, adding that they should use a ""scalpel"" not a ""hatchet"". Just a few weeks ago, Musk wielded a shiny chainsaw at a conservative conference – a visible symbol of aggressive attempts to slash government spending that have angered Democrats and concerned some officials in the Trump administration. Musk's team had sent multiple emails from an official government account to millions of federal workers, encouraging them to accept months of advance pay in exchange for their resignations. Federal workers were instructed to provide accounts of their weekly accomplishments or risk firing – a request some agencies instructed their employees to ignore. Doge also ordered the dismissal of many newly hired government employees who, because of their ""probationary"" status, did not have full civil service protections. Some government agencies have since rescinded these orders because employees deemed essential, such as those who oversee nuclear weapon security, had been affected. During an Oval Office event on Friday, Trump responded to questions about the cabinet meeting – and reports of its heated exchanges. He insisted there was ""no clash"". He praised both Rubio and Musk and said the two got along ""great"". Trump's Thursday Truth Social post, however, appears to give department heads more authority to push back against Musk. It also may be an attempt to insulate the Trump administration from lawsuits that allege Musk is wielding too much power for someone who, unlike cabinet secretaries, is not subject to Senate review and confirmation. Several federal judges overseeing these cases have already expressed concern about Musk's authority – concerns that may be further fuelled by Trump's comments during his address to Congress on Tuesday that the billionaire was, in fact, the man in charge of Doge. Musk and Trump have formed a formidable partnership so far – as the richest man in the world and the most powerful politician in America. Washington has been rife with speculation for months about whether that partnership could ultimately fracture. Those predictions, however, have usually been followed by renewed signs of comity between the two men. On Friday night, Musk was seen boarding Air Force One with the president for a flight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida for the weekend. The cabinet room dust-up may be the first crack in the foundation – but there is plenty of evidence that Trump still supports Musk's broader efforts and goals, even if he might prefer he use a scalpel in the days ahead, not a chainsaw.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rz0x0zjqzo,"What is hantavirus, disease that killed Gene Hackman's wife?","Betsy Arakawa, wife of Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman, died from a respiratory illness linked to hantavirus, a rare disease transmitted by infected rodents, officials have confirmed. Health experts warn that hantavirus can cause flu-like symptoms after exposure to rodent droppings, and in severe cases, it may develop into Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), a life-threatening lung condition. Medical investigators believe Ms Arakawa contracted HPS, which led to her death. It is believed she died a week before her husband, who was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Authorities discovered the deceased couple in their New Mexico home last month. Here's what you need to know about hantavirus. Hantavirus refers to a strain of viruses carried by rodents, primarily transmitted to humans through inhalation of airborne particles from dried rodent droppings. Infections typically occur when the virus becomes airborne from a rodent's urine, droppings, or saliva, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Though rare, it can also spread through rodent bites or scratches. In North America, deer mice are the most common carriers, according to the Mayo Clinic. The virus can cause two severe illnesses. The first, Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome - the most common strain in the US - was the illness that led to Ms Arakawa's death, officials say. Symptoms often start with fatigue, fever, and muscle aches, followed by headaches, dizziness, chills, and abdominal issues. If respiratory symptoms develop, the mortality rate is approximately 38%, according to the CDC. The second illness, Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal syndrome, is more severe and primarily affects the kidneys. The CDC reported 864 cases of hantavirus in the US between 1993 and 2022. Most of the cases were found in rural areas of western states like California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. The agency began surveillance for hantavirus diseases in 1993 during an outbreak of severe respiratory illness near the Four Corners region of the US where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah all meet. There may be around 150,000 cases of Haemorrhagic Fever with Renal syndrome worldwide each year, according to a report from the National Institutes of Health. More than half occur in China. There is no specific treatment for hantavirus infections. The CDC recommends supportive care to treat symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms may need to be admitted to hospitals in intensive care units. Some may need to be intubated in severe cases. The CDC recommends eliminating contact with rodents in homes or workplaces to reduce exposure to the virus. The agency also recommends sealing entry points in basements or attics where rodents may enter homes. Wearing protective gear is also suggested when cleaning up rodent droppings to avoid inhaling contaminated air.",2025-03-08T16:58:05.312Z,Rachel Looker
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlyz04q23qo,Canadian serial killer's victim found in landfill,"The remains of an indigenous woman murdered by a serial killer have been found after a search of a landfill in the Canadian province of Manitoba, police say. Morgan Harris' remains were recovered at the Prairie Green Landfill, north of the city of Winnipeg, said officials. Authorities had been searching for Ms Harris, 39, and Marcedes Myran, 26, both of Long Plain First Nation. Police say two sets of remains have been found. Ms Harris and Ms Myran were among four indigenous women killed in 2022 by convicted murderer Jeremy Skibicki, who dumped their bodies in two different landfills over a three-month span. The search of the Prairie Green Landfill began late last year following a lengthy pressure campaign by indigenous leaders. Cambria Harris, Morgan Harris's daughter, said in a Facebook post on Friday that the discovery of her mother's remains was a ""very bittersweet moment"". ""Please keep our families in your hearts tonight and every day going forward as we trust this process,"" the post said. Police initially declined to search the landfill, and a federal government study concluded that a search could take three years and cost up to C$184m (£100m; $128m), with workers exposed to hazardous chemicals. Manitoba eventually pledged C$20m to search for the remains - funds that were matched by the federal government. Skibicki was convicted in July last year of the murders of Ms Harris and Ms Myran, as well as of killing a third woman, Rebecca Contois, 24, of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation, and a still-unidentified woman who has been given the name Buffalo Woman. Their murders went undetected for months until a man looking for scrap metal in a bin outside Skibicki's apartment found partial human remains, identified as belonging to Ms Contois. Canada has long faced a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, indigenous women make up 10% of the population of missing women in Canada and 16% of female homicides. Indigenous women make up about 4% of the female population in Canada.",2025-03-08T03:52:32.074Z,Max Matza
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3911lv1pzko,How Britain's former top banker became Canada's next prime minister,"The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, will be Canada's next prime minister, at least for now. He will need all his experience handling global economic crises as the country faces a trade war launched by US President Donald Trump. Mark Carney was the first non-British person to become governor of the Bank of England in its more than 300-year history when he took the job in 2013. He had previously steered his home country through the Great Recession as the governor of the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank, before being poached for Britain's top banking job. But unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he won the contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau handily. Now, he must lead the country through one of its toughest challenges yet - an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the United States. But holding on to the role of PM will be a fight in and of itself. Canada's next federal election is scheduled for this October, but many expect it to be called as early as this month. Although Carney has travelled the globe, working for Goldman Sachs in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories. The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey. In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University. In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister. In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis. Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them. That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England. In his time at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, he oversaw considerable changes in how the institution worked. At the start of his tenure, the Bank assumed responsibility for financial regulation after the abolition of the Financial Services Authority. He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor. In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions. Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of ""forward guidance"", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%. Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an ""unreliable boyfriend"", a monicker which stuck around long after the original controversy died down. Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums. In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound. Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession. In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal. He described it as his ""toughest day"" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively. The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy. His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Mr Carney told the country that the economic shock ""should be temporary"".  Carney's time at the bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour. From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency. He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage. He is also known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change. His political ambitions have been rumoured for years, but until recently the 59-year-old had brushed off the idea. ""Why don't I become a circus clown?"" he told a reporter in 2012. Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation. Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post. Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods. ""I know how to manage crises,"" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. ""In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills."" Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada. The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board. They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets, which Carney currently does not need to do as he is not an elected member of parliament. His team has said he will comply with all applicable ethics rules and guidelines once he is prime minister.",2025-03-10T02:05:47.611Z,Ben King and Robin Levinson King
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd92ynwne18o,"Bourbon is out, patriotism is in - How Canadians are facing Trump threats head on","Not long after the US imposed their tariffs on Canada, a local neighbourhood pub in Toronto began removing all American products off their menu. That means nachos, wings - and of course, beer - must all be made now with local Canadian ingredients, or wherever not possible, non-US products from Europe or Mexico. For Leah Russell, manager at Toronto's Madison Avenue pub, the boycott was a no-brainer. She adds that it is ""pretty set in stone,"" even if the tariffs themselves are not. ""I'm glad that we're getting rid of American products and supporting local businesses,"" Ms Russell told the BBC on Thursday. ""I think it's an important thing to do."" This defiant stance in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs and threats against Canada has been unfolding across the northern country, even as it braces for economic blowback that it could ultimately do little to avoid in the event of a full-blown trade war. Just ask actor Jeff Douglas, once the face of Molson Canadian Beer's ""I Am Canadian"" advertisements, who has filmed and posted a light-hearted, but deeply-patriotic video on Youtube this week addressing Trump's ""51st state"" rhetoric. ""We're not the 51st anything,"" declares Mr Douglas in the video, which has since gone viral in Canada. Some of the backlash has been more symbolic, like one Montreal café changing the Americano on their menu to a ""Canadiano"" - a small gesture that the owners say is meant to display unity and support for their community and country. Even the CBC, the country's public broadcaster, is feeling the full force of this wave of patriotism, after it dared run a programme asking Canadians what they think about Canada becoming ""the 51st state"", as Trump has suggested many times. The show sparked intense backlash and accusations of ""treason,"" ""sedition"" and even ""betrayal"". Although Trump has since lifted some of the tariffs imposed this week and put others on pause until 2 April, many Canadians say the damage has already been done. After Thursday's reversal, foreign minister Melanie Joly told CNN that Canada has been shown ""too much disrespect by the Trump administration at this point, calling us a 51st state, calling our prime minister 'governor.'"" Meanwhile, Doug Ford, who is the leader of Canada's most populous province, did not back down from his plan to slap export tariffs on electricity that Canada supplies some US states. The 25% surcharge will affect up to 1.5 million American homes. ""I feel terrible for the American people because it's not the American people, and it's not even elected officials, it's one person,"" he told a local radio show on Thursday in reference to Trump. ""He's coming after his closest friends, closest allies in the world and it's going to absolutely devastate both economies,"" Ford said. Canadians support their country's reciprocal actions, saying they should remain in place until US tariffs are completely off the table. ""You go to bed every night and don't have any idea where you stand,"" said Andrew, a shopper at a Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) store in Toronto, which has stopped stocking US-made alcoholic drinks, like bourbon from Kentucky. Trump says he will delay the tariffs, ""but what does that mean?"" he asks. ""Let's keep [American-made drinks] off the shelves until we know what things are going to be from day to day."" The tariffs have been met with deep anxiety in Canada, whose majority of exports are sold to companies and clients in the US. Officials predict up to a million job losses if a 25% across the board levy went ahead, while economists warn that a recession is imminent if they persist. The potential impact is devastating enough that the Canadian government has announced it will bring in relief measures, similar to those implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help impacted individuals and businesses. Even with the tariffs being scaled back temporarily, the uncertainty alone is hurting both American and Canadian economies, says Rob Gillezeau, an assistant professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto. ""The most sensitive thing to uncertainty is business investment,"" Prof Gillezeau says, adding that firms are ""not going to want to spend a dime anywhere"" until they have some clarity. Analysts suggest the mere whiff of a trade war is likely costing Canadian companies hundreds of thousands of dollars as they try to navigate through these changes, and are likely delaying deals and disrupting trade due to the confusion. That trepidation is also seen in the stock market, which had erased virtually all its gains since Trump won the presidency in November. Trump has repeatedly said that tariffs are a response to Mexico and Canada's role in the fentanyl crisis, which has killed over 250,000 American since 2018. While only a small portion of the drug originates from Canada, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that even those numbers are significant for ""families in this country who have lost loved ones to this deadly poison"". Even small amounts of fentanyl can kill large number of people, she added. Outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has condemned the tariffs, suggesting they align with Trump's stated desire to see Canada become ""the 51st state."" ""What he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that'll make it easier to annex us,"" Trudeau told media in Ottawa Thursday. Prof Gillezeau notes that it is an especially deep wound from a neighbour whom Canada had long considered its closest friend and ally. The US and Canada have fought wars together, have boasted about having the longest ""undefended"" shared border in the world and have even engaged in joint security missions in the Arctic to defend each other's sovereignty. ""We've been allies for 100 years,"" he says, adding that many Canadians are likely upset not just with how the US has been treating Canada, but also other allies like Ukraine. ""We're a decent, honourable people, and we stand by our allies,"" Prof Gillezeau says. ""I think that's what is driving the real depth of the discontent we see."" The Canadian boycotts are already having material impact. Canadian outlet Global News has reported that leisure travel bookings to the US have plunged 40% year over year, citing data from Flight Centre Canada. That decline has also been observed in land border crossings between British Columbia and Washington State. Before the tariffs, the US was the number one international travel destination for Canadians, who have spent $20.5bn (£15.89bn) into the American tourism economy in 2024 alone. Asked if this trend will hold, Prof Gillezeau says Canadians ideally want relations to go back to normal with their neighbour. But in absence of that, the consensus in the country is that ""Canada needs to find friends elsewhere"".",2025-03-08T05:00:57.061Z,Nadine Yousif and Ali Abbas Ahmadi
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q1l398wz3o,"As US and Canada trade barbs, it's so far so good for Mexico's Sheinbaum","In announcing the decision to postpone some tariffs on Mexico for another month, US President Donald Trump was at pains to praise his Mexican counterpart, Claudia Sheinbaum. ""I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum"", he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social. ""Our relationship has been a very good one and we are working hard, together, on the border."" The comments were in stark contrast to the kind of language he has used for the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, who he continues to refer to as ""Governor Trudeau"", while calling Canada ""the 51st State"". The war of words – if not yet trade – continues between Canada and the Trump administration with Prime Minister Trudeau calling the entire tariffs policy ""dumb"" and the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, calling him a ""numbskull"" in return. The difference in tone between the US neighbour to the north and the one to the south could hardly be more striking. Some, particularly in Claudia Sheinbaum's camp, see it as evidence of her deft handling of an unpredictable leader in the White House, one who has made several bold statements of intent, only for them to be rolled back or watered down. Certainly, President Sheinbaum has delivered a singular message from the start: Mexicans should ""remain calm"" over Trump, she has said, insisting that ""cooler heads will prevail."" In that sense, it has been so far, so good for the Mexican leader. Twice, now, in two months she has managed to stave off the imposition of sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexican goods through a last-minute phone call to President Trump – even though he said there was ""no room"" for negotiation. It is testament to her diplomacy that Trump seems to genuinely appreciate her tone, clarity and overall demeanour in their interactions. She has refused to accept publicly that Mexico hasn't done enough on either of the main border issues on which Trump is demanding action from his neighbours: fentanyl trafficking and undocumented immigration north. She began Thursday's morning press briefing by referring to new figures from the US Customs and Border Protection agency which show seizures of fentanyl have dropped to 263 kilos, their lowest levels in 3 years. It represents a 75% drop in the last six months of her presidency. When tariffs were avoided in February, Sheinbaum agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border. Her administration has also extradited (although they prefer the word ""expelled"") 29 drug cartel figures to the US to face trial on charges from murder to money laundering, including a top drug lord, Rafael Caro Quintero, who has been wanted by the US authorities since the mid-1980s. Those may well have been the measures Trump was referring to when he said the two countries were ""working hard, together"" on border security. Furthermore, she has often thrown the ball back in the US president's direction. Where do the guns which arm the cartels come from, she asks rhetorically, openly calling for the US to do more to curb the flow of weapons south and tackle its demand for illegal drugs. The drugs may come from Latin America, she points out, but the market for their consumption is overwhelmingly in the US. Even when the Trump administration recently designated six Mexican cartels as ""foreign terrorist organisations"", it seemed to strengthen her hand. That's because her administration is currently embroiled in a legal battle with US gun manufacturers over negligence. If US weapons-makers have allowed their products to reach terrorists rather than mere criminals, Mexico could expand its lawsuit, she said, to include a new charge of ""complicity"" with terror groups. And yet while President Sheinbaum is enjoying a strong start to her presidency – both domestically and in the eyes of the world – for her handling of Trump, it is worth stressing that these are early days in their bilateral relationship. ""I think she has played the hand she has been dealt pretty well"", said Mexican economist, Valeria Moy. ""I'm not sure it's time for celebration just yet. But I think she has done what she can in the face of the threat of tariffs. It makes little sense for either of side to enter into a trade war."" The key to Sheinbaum's success seems to have been in refusing to back down on unreasonable requests or matters of real importance, while similarly not appearing subservient or acquiescent to the White House's demands. That is not an easy path to tread. On some questions – the Gulf of Mexico being renamed by Trump as the Gulf of America, for example – she can afford to remain above the fray knowing that most people around the world are unlikely to adopt his preferred terminology. On others, particularly tariffs, the stakes are considerably higher; there's a danger that the constant back-and-forth and instability on the issue could push the Mexican economy into recession. The Mexican peso weakened again during this latest episode and, although Sheinbaum claims the country's economy is strong, the markets would clearly prefer a more reliable and solid relationship with the US. Mexico remains the US's biggest trading partner, after all. When I spoke to President Sheinbaum on the campaign trail last year, shortly before she made history by becoming Mexico's first woman president, she said she would have no problem working with a second Trump presidency and that she would always ""defend"" what was right for Mexicans – including the millions who reside in the US. ""We must always defend our country and our sovereignty,"" she told me. With so much bluster between these three neighbours in recent days, it is easy to forget that the Trump presidency is still only six weeks old. The new relationship with the White House has a long way to go, with the USMCA trade agreement to be renegotiated next year. But certainly, amid all the political theatre, Claudia Sheinbaum will be more pleased than Justin Trudeau with how it has started.",2025-03-06T22:43:01.245Z,Will Grant
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c981w6zexj2o,Lady Gaga: My biggest fear? Being alone,"No-one wants to be alone, and no job is more isolating than being a pop star. Just ask Lady Gaga. Her rise to fame in 2009-10 was unlike anything we'd seen before. One of the first pop stars to harness the power of the internet, she seemed to exist in a permanent onslaught of TMZ photos and gossip blogs. Their appetite was voracious. She wore through so many looks and sounds in the space of three years that one critic wrote she was ""speed-running Madonna's entire career"". And as her fame grew, the headlines became more unhinged. She staged a satanic ritual in a London hotel... She was secretly a hermaphrodite... She planned to saw her own leg off ""for fashion"". When she attended the 2010 MTV Awards in a dress made entirely of meat, nobody seemed to get the joke: Gaga was presenting herself as fodder for the tabloids, there to be consumed. On stage, she was an object of worship for her fans, the Little Monsters. But anyone who isn't a megalomaniac knows that that sort of adulation is a distant illusion. ""I'm alone, Brandon. Every night,"" Gaga told her stylist in the 2017 documentary, Five Foot Two. ""I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence."" Now 38, and happily engaged to tech entrepreneur Michael Polansky, Gaga admits that those years of solitude scared her. ""I think my biggest fear was doing this by myself - doing life on my own,"" she tells the BBC. ""And I think that the greatest gift has been meeting my partner, Michael, and being in the mayhem with him.""  The couple have been together since 2020, and revealed their engagement at the Venice Film Festival last September - where Gaga wore her million-dollar engagement ring in public for the first time. In person, it's dazzling, with a huge, oval-cut diamond set on a 18-karat white and rose gold diamond pavé band. But on her other hand, Gaga sports a smaller, more understated ring, featuring a few blades of grass set in resin. It turns out that this is the really special one. ""Michael actually proposed to me with these blades of grass,"" she reveals. ""A long time ago, we were in the back yard, and he asked me, 'If I ever proposed to you, like, how do I do that?' ""And I just said, 'Just get a blade of grass from the back yard and wrap it around my finger and that will make me so happy'."" It was a deeply romantic gesture that came tinged with sadness. Gaga's back yard in Malibu had previously played host to the wedding of her close friend, Sonja Durham, shortly before she died of cancer in 2017. ""There was so much loss, but this happy thing was happening for me,"" she recalls of Polansky's proposal. ""To get engaged at 38... I was thinking about what it took to get to this moment.""  Those feelings ultimately informed a song on her new album, Mayhem. Called (naturally) Blade of Grass, it finds the star singing about a ""lovers' kiss in a garden made of thorns"", and the promise of love in a time of darkness. She calls it a ""thank you"" to her partner. And fans might have a reason to thank him, too. Mayhem marks Gaga's full throttle return to pop, after a period where she'd been preoccupied with her film career, and spin-off albums that dabbled in jazz and the classic American songbook. Speaking to Vogue last year, the singer revealed it was her fiancé who'd nudged her in that direction. ""He was like, 'Babe. I love you. You need to make pop music',"" she said. ""On the Chromatica tour, I saw a fire in her,"" Polansky added. ""I wanted to help her keep that alive all the time and just start making music that made her happy.""  With that approach, the album goes right back to the sucker-punch sound of Gaga's early hits like Poker Face, Just Dance and Born This Way. On the latest single, Abracadabra, she even revisits the ""roma-ma-ma"" gibberish of Bad Romance – although this time there's a reference to death, as she sings, ""morta-ooh-Gaga"". In the album's artwork, her face is reflected in a broken mirror. In the videos, she squares off against earlier versions of herself. There's an overwhelming sense that the artist Stefani Germanotta is reckoning with the stage persona she created. It all comes to a head on a track called Perfect Celebrity where she sings, ""I became a notorious being"" – a lyric that, like the meat dress before it, strips away her humanity. ""That's probably the most angry song about fame I've ever written,"" she says. ""I'd created this public persona that I was truly becoming in every way - and holding the duality of that, knowing where I begin and Lady Gaga ends, was really a challenge. ""It kind of took me down.""  How did she reconcile the public and private sides of her life? ""I think what I actually realised is that it's healthier to not have a dividing line and to integrate those two things into one whole human being,"" she says. ""The healthiest thing for me was owning that I'm a female artist and that living an artistic life was my choice. ""I am a lover of songwriting. I'm a lover of making music, of rehearsing, choreography, stage production, costumes, lighting, putting on a show. ""That is what it means to be Lady Gaga. It's the artist behind it all.""  In previous interviews, the musician has spoken of how she dissociated from Lady Gaga. For a time, she believed the character was responsible for all her success, and she had contributed nothing. Mayhem marks the moment where she reclaims ownership of her music, not just from ""Lady Gaga"" but from other producers and writers in her orbit. ""When I was younger, people tried take credit for my sound, or my image [but] all of my references, all of my imagination of what pop music could be, came from me. ""So I really wanted to revisit my earlier inspirations and my career and own it as my invention, for once and for all.""  From the outset, it was obvious that Gaga was excited about this new phase. Last summer, after performing at the Olympics opening ceremony, she took to the streets of Paris and played early demos of her new music to fans who'd gathered outside her hotel. It was a spur of the moment decision, yet it marked another effort to restore the spontaneity of her early career. ""This has been something I've done for almost 20 years, where I played my fans my music way before it came out,"" she says. ""I used to, after my shows, invite fans backstage, and we'd hang out and I'd play them demos and see what they thought of the music. ""I'm sure you can imagine that after 20 years, you don't expect that people are still going to show up to hear your music and be excited to see you. So, I just wanted to share it with them, because I was excited that they were there.""  As an interviewer, this is a full-circle moment for me, too. I last interviewed Lady Gaga in 2009, as Just Dance hit number one in the UK. Back then, she was giddy with excitement, chatting enthusiastically about her love of John Lennon, calling herself a ""heroin addict"" for English tea, and promising to email me an MP3 of Blueberry Kisses – an unreleased song that is, quite brilliantly, about performing a sex act while your breath smells of blueberry flavoured coffee. Over the years, I've seen her interviews become more guarded. She'd wear outrageous costumes or jet-black sunglasses, deliberately putting a barrier between her and the journalist. But the Gaga I meet in New York is the same one I spoke to 16 years ago: comfortable with herself, and brimming with enthusiasm. She puts that ease down to ""growing up and living a full life"". ""Being there for my friends, being there for my family, meeting my amazing fiancé - all of these things made me a whole person, instead of the most important thing being my stage persona."" With an air of finality, she adds: ""I wanted Mayhem to have an ending. I wanted the chaos to stop. ""I stepped away from the icon. It ends with love.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7v1ejv01go,This city helped the US back Ukraine. Now its role is uncertain,"US President Donald Trump's pause on military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine has left the war-torn country's residents uncertain about their futures and rattled America's European allies. But it also hit far closer to home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, a city about 4,700 miles (7,560km) away from Kyiv that has played its own small role in the conflict. Scranton is known as the setting for the American version of The Office television show, and as the birthplace of former President Joe Biden - one of Ukraine's biggest backers. But after Russia invaded Ukraine, it has become known as the home of the Scranton Army Artillery Plant among those who have followed the conflict closely. Owned by the US government and operated by defence contractor General Dynamics, the plant produces the 155mm artillery rounds - a key munition that has helped the Ukrainians keep Russian advances at bay. These rounds are used daily, as the conflict grinds on into World War I-style trench battles and artillery strikes. ""Scranton is the only place the metal cases for 155mm ammunition are made in the US,"" said former Defense Department official Christine Michienzi, who led the effort to scale up production of weapons systems sent to Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky toured the plant during a whirlwind trip to Scranton in September 2024, shaking hands with staff and observing its machinery. Scranton is one of three plants in Pennsylvania that has increased production of the 155 mm rounds since the start of the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Between 2009 to 2017, they collectively produced about 9,000 rounds per month. By the time of Zelensky's visit last year, the facilities had ramped up their output to 36,000 rounds monthly, the US Army said. During the Oval Office meeting that caused the Trump administration's relationship with Ukraine to collapse, Vice-President JD Vance cited the tour to accuse Zelensky of campaigning ""for the opposition"" during his visit. Despite all the politicial drama, this Pennslyvania community continues to see its work as representing the US commitment to Ukraine, said Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti. ""We have multiple Ukrainian churches here. We have quite the diaspora of Ukrainian Americans,"" Cognetti said. St Vladimir Ukrainian Catholic Church in Scranton has raised funds for the war effort and hosted Ukrainian soldiers at community events. ""Scranton has a very proud history of supporting Ukraine,"" Cognetti told the BBC, ""and it's been a really tough couple of weeks here, as we see that support erode from the US administration."" Cognetti was unsettled by the Oval Office argument between Trump, Zelensky, and Vance last Friday. ""To see US policy shift and potentially to have the US really turn its back on Ukraine is really appalling,"" she said. The Scranton artillery plant ""ensures warfighters have the ammo when and where needed, and continues to bolster US stockpiles around the globe,"" said Lt Gen Chris Mohan, deputy commanding general and acting commander, in a statement about Zelensky's visit. Cognetti said that the plant had added ""many dozens"" of jobs and increased capacity during the Ukraine war, estimating that about 400 people worked there when Zelensky visited. But with the Trump administration now pressuring Zelensky to end the war, Scranton's role in geopolitics could be winding down. US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz confirmed on Wednesday that the White House had paused intelligence sharing with Kyiv, telling reporters: ""We have taken a step back."" The Trump administration is reviewing ""all aspects of this relationship"", he added. Republican lawmakers have backed Trump's recent actions, which they see as key to negotiating an end to the war. ""I think the president just wants to get everybody to the table, and I think he's making progress,"" South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds told reporters. There are different estimates for how much military aid the US has given Ukraine, a BBC Verify analysis found. The German-based Kiel Institute estimated the total at $119.7bn (£94.3bn). The US Department of Defense provided a total of $182.8bn, which includes spending on Operation Atlantic Resolve - a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Fedir Venislavsky, a member of the Ukrainian parliament's defence committee, told the BBC that without US military aid, front-line soldiers would be able to last ""maybe six months."" The region is home to multiple military manufacturing plants, including a Lockheed Martin facility and the larger Tobyhanna Army Depot, which also produces some supplies for Ukraine. Representatives for the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant declined to comment on how the pause could impact the plant and jobs. On Tuesday, cars pulled into the secure facility as usual, and its car park appeared full. ""Even if there is a permanent freeze, Scranton will continue to produce large numbers of 155mm ammunition for the foreseeable future,"" said Ms Michienzi. ""It will take many years to manufacture millions of rounds to replenish US inventories, plus rounds for some of our allies."" Any effect would be minor for Scranton's economy, local officials said. The plant ""is not the largest employer by any stretch,"" said Bob Durkin, president of the non-partisan Scranton Chamber of Commerce. ""But it's a very important employer. The jobs are really high quality jobs. They are well paying, family sustaining jobs."" Outside the plant's gates, Scranton's perspective on the war remains divided. Though Scranton, in north-east Pennsylvania, is a historically Democratic area, Republicans have made political gains in the region. In the 2024 presidential election, Trump won the state, but narrowly lost Lackawanna County, where Scranton is located, to then-Vice-President Kamala Harris. However, in the House race, Republican Rob Bresnahan ousted Democratic congressman, Matt Cartwright, by just 6,200 votes. Trump campaigned against US spending on Ukraine, a pledge that resonated with his base. On Tuesday, just before his speech before Congress, denizens at the local Poor Richards dive bar were split on Ukraine - and what role Scranton ought to play on the world stage. ""I feel really angry about the way Trump handled the meeting with Zelensky,"" said Brandon Lux, 35, who worked in mental healthcare in Scranton. ""Halting all government funding to Ukraine right now, I think that that will definitely have implications for what happens here in our city."" But other residents felt Trump was correct to pressure Zelensky and to reassess Biden's support of the embattled country. ""We don't have money to give them, we have to take care of our people first,"" said Fran Fitzgerald, who described herself as a ""big fan"" of Trump. Ms Fitzgerald said she hoped the Trump administration could direct the funds being used in Ukraine to projects like fixing Scranton's ""terrible roads"" and potholes. Mike Pierson, an electrician, voted for Trump but does not necessarily agree with all his actions so far. The self-identified independent worried that Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency taskforce would endanger his Social Security benefits. He hopes to retire within the next five years. But Mr Pierson echoed the president's argument that the US should not be spending money abroad on conflicts like Ukraine, but back at home. ""We're the world's bank, we're the world's insurance policy,"" he said. ""We need to stop.""",2025-03-06T10:12:30.777Z,Kayla Epstein
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wkg47z1po,Canada's next PM Mark Carney vows to win trade war with Trump,"Mark Carney has won the race to succeed Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, vowing to win the trade war with the US and President Donald Trump. The former governor of the Canadian central bank and Bank of England beat three rivals in the Liberal Party's leadership contest in a landslide. In much of his victory speech, Carney, 59, attacked Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canada and said he wants to make the country the 51st US state. ""Americans should make no mistake,"" he said. ""In trade, as in hockey, Canada will win."" Carney is expected to be sworn in the coming days and will lead the Liberals in the next general election, which could be called in the coming weeks. Carney, now prime minister-designate, has never served in elected office. The Liberal leadership race began in January after Trudeau resigned following nearly a decade in office. He had faced internal pressure to quit over deep unpopularity with voters, who were frustrated with a housing crisis and the rising cost of living. Carney won on the first ballot on Sunday evening, taking 85.9% of the vote to beat his nearest rival, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. Loud cheers erupted as the results were announced to a crowd of some 1,600 party faithful in Ottawa, Canada's capital. The party said more than 150,000 people had cast ballots in the race. Carney, who will lead a minority government in parliament, could either call a snap general election himself or opposition parties could force one with a no-confidence vote later this month. The governing Liberals have seen a remarkable political turnaround since Trudeau's exit, as Canadians have been galvanised by Donald Trump's trade threats and support for annexing their country At the beginning of the year, they trailed the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, by more than 20 points in election polls. They have since narrowed the gap and some polls show them statistically tied with Poilievre's party. Much of Carney's speech focused on what he called Trump's ""unjustified tariffs"" on Canada, America's largest trading partner. The US imposed levies of 25% on Canadian goods last Tuesday, but rowed back within days to exempt goods compliant with an existing trade agreement. Canada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own as Trudeau accused his US counterpart of trying to collapse the country's economy. Carney echoed that in his victory speech, saying Trump was ""attacking Canadian workers, families, and businesses"". ""We can't let him succeed,"" he added, as the crowd booed loudly. He said his government would keep tariffs on US imports ""until the Americans show us respect"". Canada's economy depends significantly on trade with the US and risks tipping into recession if the sweeping tariffs threatened by Trump are fully imposed. ""I know these are dark days,"" Carney said. ""Dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust. ""We're getting over the shock, but let us never forget the lessons: we have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other. We need to pull together in the tough days ahead."" Carney also pledged to ""secure our borders"" - a key demand of Trump who has accused Canada of failing to control the flow of migrants and fentanyl going south. The US president even got a mention in Carney's attacks on his main opponent, Conservative leader Poilievre. ""Pierre Poilievre's plan will leave us divided and ready to be conquered,"" said Carney. ""Because a person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him."" Shortly before Carney took to the stage, Trudeau gave an emotional farewell speech, reflecting on his 12 years as Liberal leader. He warned that Canada was facing an ""existential challenge"" from the US under Trump. The Conservatives have had to pivot politically since Trudeau's resignation, and are attacking Carney as not representing change but rather being ""just like Justin"". They accuse the Liberals of a ""sneaky"" plan to win a fourth term by simply substituting their leader. Poilievre's party has also accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York. Carney said the formal decision by shareholders to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board at the start of this year but a letter emerged showing he had recommended the move in December. Federal Public Safety Minister David McGuinty, who endorsed Carney, told the BBC that he ""embodies the kind of quiet determination, but steely determination and competence to deal with some of these big issues"". ""I'm really, really excited for what's coming. And frankly, it's time for an election."" The Liberals will face Poilievre's Conservatives, who are the official opposition with 120 seats in the House of Commons; the Bloc Quebecois, who have 33 seats; and the New Democrats, who have 24, when Canadians next go to the polls. The former central banker has run on a broadly centrist agenda, a shift from Trudeau, who moved the Liberals to the left. A major promise is to push forward major energy projects like pipelines, which have faced political roadblocks in recent years. He has promised major investments in housing and clean energy projects, and to liberalise trade within Canada, where barriers remain between provinces, as well as diversifying the economy away from the US. During the leadership race, Carney promised to cap the size of the federal government, which expanded 40% under Trudeau.",2025-03-10T03:13:48.780Z,Jessica Murphy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2yd0el491o,Man charged with manslaughter after Louisiana student hazing death,"A man has been charged in connection with the death of a Louisiana college student who collapsed after being repeatedly punched in the chest during a hazing ritual, police said. Officials said Caleb McCray, 23, a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, allegedly punched Caleb Wilson multiple times during the off-campus initiation ceremony. He was charged with criminal hazing and manslaughter. Mr Wilson was a 20-year-old college band member and mechanical engineering student at Southern University and A&M, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The suspect's lawyer said in a statement his client deserved due process and asked the public ""to withhold rushing to judgment until all the evidence is heard"". Hazing, which is illegal in most US states, is a tradition where people pledge their loyalty by doing something painful, humiliating or dangerous. Speaking at a news conference, Baton Rouge Police Chief Thomas Morse Jr stated that Mr Wilson's death on 27 February was a ""direct result"" of the hazing incident. According to police, a group of individuals dropped Mr Wilson off at a hospital and allegedly lied to the staff, saying he had collapsed while playing basketball. They left before authorities arrived. But detectives later determined that information to be inaccurate. A police arrest report reviewed by US media outlets states that Mr Wilson and eight others pledging the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity were struck by Mr McCray and at least two others wearing boxing gloves. Mr McCray allegedly hit Mr Wilson four times in the chest, after which he collapsed, suffered a seizure, and lost control of his bodily functions, the arrest warrant affidavit said. No-one present attempted to call for emergency assistance, police said. Mr Wilson was later pronounced dead at the hospital. An autopsy found no significant trauma to his body, aside from a small bruise on the right side of his chest, according to the affidavit. It also noted that investigators found no indication that Mr McCray intended to ""cause death or great bodily harm to any of the pledges"". Mr McCray, a member of Omega Psi Phi and reportedly a Louisiana Army National Guard member, is said to have graduated from Southern University in December 2024, according to ABC News. East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore said two additional people, who have not been publicly identified, will be charged with misdemeanour hazing. The investigation is ongoing and remains active. Southern University System President Dennis Shields expressed deep sorrow over Mr Wilson's death. ""Words cannot express how deeply saddened we are by the loss of our student, Caleb Wilson,"" he said. Mr Shields said the campus chapter of Omega Psi Phi has been ordered to suspend all activities. Students involved in the incident could face expulsion. Additionally, all Greek organisations at the university - a historically black college - have been barred from accepting new members for the remainder of the academic year. Mr Wilson's passing has sparked widespread grief. The Human Jukebox Marching Band, which recently performed at the Super Bowl, honoured him in a Facebook post. ""A talented trumpet player, a dedicated student, and a bright soul, Caleb was a mechanical engineering major who poured his passion into both his studies and his time with the Human Jukebox. His energy, spirit, and impact on those around him will never be forgotten."" Hundreds of people gathered for a vigil outside Southern University's Smith-Brown Student Union. One friend, speaking of Mr Wilson, told local media outlet WAFB: ""His light does not die with himself. It dies with all of us. We have to make sure his light lives within all of us and make sure you stand up tall like he's on your shoulders reaching for the sky."" The Omega Psi Phi Fraternity released a statement offering condolences and supporting law enforcement's efforts ""to seek the truth"". Under Louisiana state law, if a person dies or is seriously injured during a hazing ritual, it can be prosecuted as a criminal offence under the Max Gruver Act. Max Gruver was a Louisiana State University student who died of alcohol poisoning after hazing in 2018. Those prosecuted can face up to a $10,000 (£7,745) fine and five years in prison. Organisations and educational institutions can also face penalties under the act.",2025-03-08T21:58:44.303Z,Alys Davies
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp979w055o,"Trump pulls $400m from Columbia University, saying it failed to protect Jewish students","The Trump administration is immediately pulling $400m (£310m) of federal funding from Columbia University, saying it failed to fight antisemitism on campus. A statement by four federal agencies said the funding cut was due to ""continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students"". The New York college was the epicentre of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses last year against war in Gaza and US support for Israel. Earlier this week, President Trump had threatened to pull funding from schools and universities that allow ""illegal protests"". Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in Friday's statement that Jewish students on campus who had been the victims of ""relentless violence, intimidation, and antisemitic harassment on their campuses"" were ""ignored"" by university authorities. ""Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer,"" she said. A spokesman for Columbia told the BBC that the university is reviewing the announcement, and pledged to work with the government to restore its federal funding. ""We take Columbia's legal obligations seriously and understand how serious this announcement is and are committed to combating antisemitism and ensuring the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff,"" she said. Columbia is one of the most prestigious universities in the US and has about 30,000 students. Its famous Morningside Heights campus is on the west side of Manhattan. Last year, the Ivy League university saw some of the largest and most tense campus demonstrations in the US as students protested against Israel's military operation in Gaza. The Israeli military launched its campaign against Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack into Israel on 7 October 2023, which left about 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage. Some 48,440 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire deal was reached in January, but looks increasingly fragile after the first phase expired recently. A campus-wide email sent out by Columbia interim president Katrina Armstrong on Friday described a ""time of great risk to our university"", according to the New York Times. ""There is no question that the cancellation of these funds will immediately impact research and other critical functions of the University, impacting students, faculty, staff, research, and patient care,"" she wrote. In the 2024 fiscal year, federal funding accounted for $1.3bn of the university's annual operating revenue, according to the Columbia Daily Spectator student newspaper. The decision to pull aid from Columbia was criticised by New York Civil Liberties Union director Donna Lieberman, who called it an illegal move ""to coerce colleges and universities into censoring student speech and advocacy that isn't Maga-approved, like criticising Israel or supporting Palestinian rights"". Last April, the pro-Palestinian protesters took over a building on campus known as Hamilton Hall, renaming it 'Hind's Hall' - in honour of a five-year-old girl, Hind Rajab, who was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza in January 2024. The protests led to the resignation of Columbia University President Minouche Shafik in August, making her the third president of an Ivy League university to step down over their handling of Gaza war protests. One student member of a Jewish campus group told the Associated Press news agency that he welcomed the move to punish Columbia. Brian Cohen said he hoped it would be ""a wake-up call to Columbia's administration and trustees to take antisemitism and the harassment of Jewish students and faculty seriously"". Pro-Palestinian demonstrators continued protesting at Columbia recently. On Friday, the university confirmed that four students were arrested for a ""disruption"" on Wednesday at Barnard College - a separate institution affiliated to Columbia - adding they had been ""suspended and restricted from campus"".",2025-03-08T02:49:17.875Z,Ali Abbas Ahmadi
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2yd7k8471o,Dolly Parton releases new song honouring late husband Carl Thomas Dean,"Dolly Parton offered an emotional tribute to her late husband, Carl Thomas Dean, who died earlier this week. The legendary country artist released a new song titled, If You Hadn't Been There, in an Instagram post on Friday. ""I fell in love with Carl Dean when I was 18 years old,"" Parton wrote. ""We have spent 60 precious and meaningful years together. Like all great love stories, they never end. They live on in memory and song. He will always be the star of my life story, and I dedicate this song to him."" The pair were together for six decades before he died on Monday aged 82. Her voice trembles as she sings the new song, ""If you hadn't been there / Where would I be? / Without your trust, love, and belief"". ""You made me drеam / More than I dared,"" she continues. ""And I wouldn't be hеre / If you hadn't been there."" The cover of the track includes an old photo showing Parton with her arms wrapped around Dean. Parton, 79, expressed her gratitude for fans' support after her husband's death. ""This is a love note to family, friends, and fans,"" she wrote on Instagram on Thursday. ""Thank you for all the messages, cards, and flowers that you've sent to pay your respects for the loss of my beloved husband Carl. I can't reach out personally to each of you but just know it has meant the world to me. He is in God's arms now and I am okay with that. I will always love you."" The singer, known for songs such as 9-5 and Jolene, met Dean outside a laundromat the first day she arrived in Nashville as an 18-year-old aspiring singer. ""I was surprised and delighted that while he talked to me, he looked at my face (a rare thing for me),"" Parton said when recalling their first meeting. ""He seemed to be genuinely interested in finding out who I was and what I was about."" Two years later, in 1966, the pair married. They lived a private life - Dean was rarely seen in public - and did not have children together.",2025-03-07T23:00:20.720Z,Ana Faguy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmjmymg0no,Trump team hits pause on tariffs - but still sees them as vital tool,"It may have been drowned out this week as US President Donald Trump walked back tariffs on his closest neighbours - and biggest trading partners - almost as soon as they were in place. But despite the dizzying back-and-forth with Canada and Mexico, the White House made clear that it is serious about its economic vision. And it is willing to pay the price of some short-term economic harm to pursue it. ""There'll be a little disturbance,"" Trump warned in his address to Congress on Tuesday. ""But we're okay with that."" Some scepticism about that comfort might be understandable, given the abrupt policy turns on tariffs Trump has made, as financial markets dropped and the outcry from US businesses intensified. Those who see Trump's tariff threats as economic bluster might be tempted to conclude that he wants to talk tough, but flinches at the first signs of economic damage. But that view is to some extent undermined by the trade war against China he started in his first term which has seriously intensified. In just a few weeks, Trump has raised taxes to at least 20% on all Chinese imports. It means the average effective tariff rate on imports from China now stands at roughly 34%, because taxes on some sectors - like electric vehicles and steel - stand at much higher rates. The 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods hasn't completely gone away either. The levy still stands on goods that aren't compliant with a trade deal that Trump negotiated in his first term - and so some goods coming from both neighbours will still be subject to it. The White House also says its much-touted reciprocal tariffs targeting nearly all US trade partners are still in the pipeline. The details, they say, will be unveiled on 2 April, with rates tailor-made to address whatever policies other countries impose that officials consider unfair - whether in the form of taxes on US tech firms, Value-Added Taxes, or other import rules. ""It's a certainty – reciprocal tariffs are coming,"" Trump's senior adviser on trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro told business broadcaster CNBC on Friday. He said the White House had seen signs that its threats alone were prompting car companies to start taking action and bolster their supply chains in the US - exactly the kind of investment that Donald Trump says his tariffs will spur. ""They're getting the picture,"" Navarro said. Navarro and others say the nitty-gritty of tariff rates is not their focus. Rather, they are using trade levies as a means to create a new version of America, where the country has a different relationship with its global partners. That America has more local manufacturing, a smaller government and pays less for the military defence of its allies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent - a former Wall Street hedge fund boss not known as a tariff hawk - this week pointed to political discussions in Germany about boosting its military spending as an ""early, big win"". ""The international trading system consists of a web of relationships - military economic, political. One cannot take a single aspect in isolation,"" he said, as he tried to sell the administration's strategy to a tariff-sceptical audience at the Economic Club of New York. ""This is how President Trump sees the world - not as a zero-sum game but as inter-linkages that can be re-ordered to advance the interests of American people."" For Trump, tariffs are a key tool for re-ordering that web. And the treasury secretary made clear that the likely short-term harm - higher prices - is an acceptable trade-off. ""Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream,"" Bessent said. For now, polls indicate Trump's voter base remains behind him. But how the next months unfold - and what happens in particular with consumer prices - could prove a real test of that message.",2025-03-07T22:54:54.026Z,Natalie Sherman
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlyy1rld0ko,"Hackman and wife died of natural causes several days apart, officials say","US investigators believe Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his classical pianist wife, Betsy Arakawa, both died of natural causes about a week apart. Their bodies were discovered in their home in the US state of New Mexico on 26 February, 10 days after Hackman is believed to have died. In a press conference on Friday, officials said Hackman died from ""significant heart disease"" on 18 February, according to cardiac data obtained from his pacemaker. Arakawa died a week earlier on 11 February of complications related to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare respiratory illness caused by exposure to infected rodents. The medical examiner added that Hackman was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, which meant it was ""possible"" he was not aware of his wife's death in the days after. Here is what we know about the death of a Hollywood legend known for such films as The French Connection and The Conversation. Warning: this article contains details some readers may find upsetting  The bodies of the couple and one of their dogs were found by police on Wednesday at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a maintenance worker called emergency services. In a recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC, the emotional caller can be heard telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies. Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen while Arakawa, 65, was found in a bathroom, at the property on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park. The couple appeared to have been ""dead for quite a while"", said Sheriff Adan Mendoza last month. Arakawa's body showed signs of ""decomposition"", and ""mummification"" in the hands and feet, a sheriff's detective said. Hackman's remains ""showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent"" with those on his spouse. A German Shepherd dog owned by the couple was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Arakawa. No cause was given in police statements immediately after the announcement of the deaths. The authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths ""suspicious enough"" to investigate and did not rule out foul play. A carbon monoxide poisoning test came out negative for both Arakawa and Hackman, the Santa Fe Sheriff's office said on Friday. Near Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she had abruptly fallen to the ground. An autopsy and toxicology tests had been requested for both Hackman and Arakawa. Authorities said it could be a few months before the results of those are released. The local utility company found no sign of a gas leak in the area and the fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant. A prescription bottle and scattered pills lay on the bathroom countertop close to Arakawa's body. Prescription pills found in the home were common medications for thyroid and high blood pressure, according to a search warrant. Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane lay next to his body. The detective suspected that the actor had suffered a sudden fall. At the time, the circumstances of their deaths were deemed ""suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation"", the search warrant said, because the worker who called emergency services had found the front door of the property open. However, the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. ""There was no indication of a struggle,"" said Sheriff Mendoza. ""There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed, you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred."" Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one out. Authorities said Hackman's pacemaker last registered activity on 17 February, adding that this gives them a good assumption that was his last day of life. But police said it is unclear who died first - Hackman or Arakawa. Now, they know Arakawa died first. The two maintenance workers who found the couple, one of whom called the emergency services, said they last had contact with the couple two weeks earlier. The two said they had sometimes conducted routine work at the property, but rarely ever saw Hackman and Arakawa. They had communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Arakawa. Hackman's daughter Leslie Anne Hackman told the Mail Online that her father had been in ""very good physical condition"" despite his age, and had not undergone ""any major surgeries"" in recent months. ""He liked to do Pilates and yoga, and he was continuing to do that several times a week,"" she said. ""So he was in good health."" The couple, married in 1991, had had a ""wonderful marriage"", she added. ""I give credit to his wife, Betsy, for keeping him alive,' she said. '[Betsy] took very, very good care of him and was always looking out for his health.""",2025-03-07T22:41:58.432Z,Patrick Jackson
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zq7zvrpqo,Meghan's new Netflix show renewed for second series,"The Duchess of Sussex has announced that With Love, Meghan will be back for a second series. The eight-part Netflix show, which sees Meghan share cooking, gardening and hosting tips with friends and famous guests at a California estate, launched on the streaming platform on Tuesday. A few hours later, the former Suits actress officially launched her new brand As Ever, with an updated website revealing raspberry spread and flower sprinkes will be among the first products to be sold. Tudum, the official companion site to Netflix, confirmed that filming had completed on the second season of the show and it will be streamed in the autumn. The announcement came after the first series attracted critical reviews in both the UK and the US. Since its launch on Tuesday, one review in The Guardian described it as a ""gormless lifestyle filler"" and ""so pointless it might be the Sussexes' last TV show"", while The Telegraph gave it two stars and branded it ""insane"" and an ""exercise in narcissism"". The series has a rating of 33% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. However, the BBC's royal correspondent Sean Coughlan wrote that ""the new Netflix series...is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day"". The show centres around Meghan preparing treats, foods and gifts at a beautiful property, although not her own home, in Montecito. She makes pasta, crudités, focaccia, frittata and baked fish, and along with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows viewers how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts. Guests in the first series include American actress and producer Mindy Kaling, celebrity chef Roy Choi, designer Tracy Robbins and cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson. On Friday, Meghan posted a video to Instagram which showed her wearing a hat with the writing ""lettuce romaine calm"" stitched across the front of it. The caption read: ""Lettuce romaine calm... or not (!) because I'm thrilled to share that Season 2 of 'With Love, Meghan' is coming!"" In a second post, she wrote: ""If you're loving Season 1, just wait until you see the fun we cooked up on Season 2! ""Thanks for joining the party, and an endless thanks to the amazing team and crew who helped bring it all to life!"" The first series was originally due to air in January but was postponed until March due to the Los Angeles wildfires. In a statement at the time, Netflix described the upcoming programme as a ""heartfelt tribute to the beauty of southern California"", adding that it was delaying its launch due to ""ongoing devastation"" in the US state.",2025-03-07T19:35:32.769Z,Lucy Clarke-Billings
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd92yn1k89do,'I'm freaking out': Text messages show housemates' panic during Idaho students' murders,"Newly released text messages and phone calls show the fear of two University of Idaho students as someone broke into their home and murdered four of their housemates in 2022. ""I'm freaking out,"" one roommate wrote to the other, court filings obtained by US media reportedly show. The text messages were sent nearly eight hours before the roommates called authorities to report one of their roommates unconscious at their home. The trial of Bryan Kohberger, who was arrested in the roommates' murders and has pleaded not guilty to those charges, is scheduled to start later this year. The fatal stabbings of four University of Idaho students - Kaylee Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen - in their off-campus home on 13 November, shocked Moscow, Idaho, a small college town and the nation. Two other housemates, identified in court filings as D.M. and B.F., are presumed to be Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke, who both lived in the house and survived the attack. Newly released communications between the two offer some insight into what happened during the hours when police believe the murders occurred and in the aftermath. ""No one is answering,"" D.M. texted B.F. between 4:22 a.m. and 4:24 a.m. ""I'm rlly confused rn."" ""Kaylee,"" D.M. texted Goncalves. ""What's going on."" And then to B.F.: ""I'm freaking out rn."" In the messages to B.F., D.M. references someone in ""like a ski mask almost"" in the house. B.F. replies, ""Stfu"". ""I'm not kidding,"" D.M. writes, adding she is ""so freaked out."" ""Come to my room,"" B.F. says. ""Run."" Prosecutors want to use these messages to piece together the timeline of the early autumn morning. Both housemates are expected to testify at the capital murder trial scheduled for August. A call to police, also detailed in the new fillings, was made just after the ""unresponsive body"" of Kernodle was found, and hours after the intruder was first spotted in the house. ""Um, one of our -- one of the roommates who's passed out and she was drunk last night and she's not waking up,"" the caller tells authorities, according to the transcript. One of the surviving housemates previously told investigators that noise woke her early that morning, but when she looked outside her bedroom, she did not see anything. Later, she told investigators, when she opened her door again, she saw a masked man in black clothing walking toward her. He walked by her towards a sliding glass door and she locked herself in her room. Officials said they think that's when the suspect left the home. The suspect in the case, Mr Kohberger, was a Washington State University graduate student in criminology. He was arrested in December 2022, six weeks after the murders. He was indicted in May 2023. Prosecutors claim they have DNA evidence tying Mr Kohberger to the crime scene and are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted. Meanwhile, Mr Kohberger's attorneys have questioned the accuracy of the DNA testing and have asked for the death penalty to be taken off the table.",2025-03-07T19:03:29.191Z,Ana Faguy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo,Second person dies in US measles outbreak,"A measles outbreak in the American southwest has killed a second person, an unvaccinated adult, New Mexico health officials have said. The fatality comes roughly a week after measles took the life of an unvaccinated child in nearby Texas, the first US death from the disease since 2015. Measles, which was considered ""eliminated"" in the US in 2000, is spreading quickly in Texas, with the state identifying 198 cases as of Friday, nearly 30 more since the state's last report on Tuesday. In the same span the number of cases in neighbouring New Mexico tripled, to 30. The disease has also been reported in other states and across Canada, as well. The person who died in New Mexico was a resident of Lea County, about 50 miles (80km) from Gaines County, Texas, where the outbreak appears to be centred. Officials did not provide the person's sex or age. One in every five measles cases requires hospitalisation and about three in every 1,000 cases results in death, the New Mexico health department said on Thursday. The current outbreak killed a healthy but unvaccinated six-year-old in Texas, state officials said on 27 Feb. While the disease was declared eliminated 25 years ago, the US often sees outbreaks, which are defined as three or more related cases. Still, the two deaths are jarring to many in a country that, before last week, had not recorded anyone killed by measles since 2015. The 2015 death was the first one attributed to measles in the US since 2003. Three months into 2025, the total number of reported infections in the US has already climbed above 220. There were 285 cases over the entire year of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC has said it is monitoring the current outbreak, which is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community in Texas with low vaccination rates. While the outbreak is mostly occurring in Texas and New Mexico, measles has also recently been found in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Washington according to the CDC. Canada is also seeing a spike in infections, and recorded more cases in the first two months of this year than in all of 2024, the country's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said on Thursday. Measles has been found in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, which Dr Tam attributed to travellers who were exposed to the disease in another country. As of Thursday, there were 227 measles cases reported this year in Canada and most of those who became ill were not vaccinated, according to the country's public health agency. The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and they also immunise people against mumps and rubella. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - who is known in part for being a vaccine sceptic - published an editorial on Sunday expressing his concern about the growing measles outbreak. ""Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinate due to medical reasons,"" he wrote in Fox News Op-Ed.",2025-03-07T18:07:16.822Z,Ana Faguy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86p0wzjv0do,South Carolina man to be executed in US by firing squad,"A South Carolina prison inmate convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents with a baseball bat will be the first person in the US to be executed by firing squad in 15 years. If Brad Sigmon's execution proceeds on Friday at 18:00 local time (23:00 GMT), three state corrections department volunteers standing behind a curtain will simultaneously fire rifles at his chest with specially designed bullets. The state's procedure requires that those put to death by firing squad be strapped to a chair when they enter the execution chamber. The inmate then has a target placed on his heart and a bag put over his head. Sigmon, 67, was convicted of murdering David and Gladys Larke in 2001 before kidnapping his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint. She later escaped as he shot at her. Offered the alternatives of death by electric chair or lethal injection, Sigmon's lawyers said he chose the more violent process because of his concerns about the effectiveness of the other two methods. He will be the first person to be executed by firing squad in the US since 2010, and only the fourth since the country reintroduced the death penalty in 1976. Sigmon was charged with murder in 2001 after investigators said he killed his ex-girlfriend's parents in their home in Greenville County by alternately beating them with a bat. He also told detectives that he planned to harm his ex-girlfriend before she escaped. ""I couldn't have her. I wasn't going to let anybody else have her,"" he told them. The South Carolina Supreme Court this week rejected a request from Sigmon's lawyers to intervene. They wanted more time to learn about the drug South Carolina uses in lethal injections and questioned whether his 2002 legal representation was adequate. That is expected to be his final appeal ahead of Friday's planned execution. No South Carolina governor has granted clemency to an inmate facing execution since the US legalised the death penalty again in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Execution by firing squad is complex. Sigmon will be strapped in a chair with a basin built below it to catch his blood. A target will be placed on his chest and a bag over his head. Three state corrections department volunteers hidden behind a curtain will then fire at him from 15ft (4.6m) away. The bullets used are designed to break apart on impact and cause maximum damage. Medical experts have debated the amount of pain caused by their use. After the shots are fired, a doctor will confirm Sigmon's death. The state allows witnesses to observe the death from behind bulletproof glass, but the executioners will be hidden from view to protect their identities. South Carolina passed a law in 2023 requiring that the the identities of the execution team members remain secret. It also forbids the publication of information regarding the procurement of lethal injection drugs, as a growing number of pharmaceutical companies have declined to provide them for state executions. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit challenging the state law in January. South Carolina spent $54,000 (£41,841) constructing its firing squad area in 2022 as suppliers refused to provide prison officials with the lethal chemicals required for death by injection. The 2023 law now shields many details about the lethal injection procedure, as well, including the names of suppliers and the exact contents. Most inmates sentenced to death in the state are electrocuted, but the three most recent executions were by injections that included pentobarbital. The three men were declared dead 20 minutes after being given the injection, though they appeared to stop breathing after a few minutes. The lack of information about these executions has attracted criticism for its lack of transparency. ""This ban not only further departs from the state's history of making execution-related information publicly available but criminalizes the disclosure of this information by anyone for any reason,"" The ACLU argued in its legal complaint. ""It thus silences the scientists, doctors, journalists, former correctional officials, lawyers, and citizens who have scrutinized the safety, efficacy, morality, and legality of South Carolina's use of lethal injection."" Sigmon has expressed concern about the effectiveness of lethal injection. South Carolina has released only one of two available autopsies from these deaths, which Sigmon's lawyer say show unusual amounts of fluid in the person's lungs. Speaking about the decision not to die by injection, his attorney told AP: ""He does not wish to inflict that pain on his family, the witnesses, or the execution team. But, given South Carolina's unnecessary and unconscionable secrecy, Brad is choosing as best he can."" Nationally, only three people have died by firing squad since 1976.",2025-03-07T10:07:05.112Z,Ottilie Mitchell
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj92wgeyvzzo,"SpaceX rocket explodes, raining debris from sky for second time in a row","A SpaceX rocket exploded shortly after it was launched from Texas on Thursday, grounding flights and triggering warnings about falling spaceship debris. SpaceX confirmed the un-crewed ship had suffered ""a rapid unscheduled disassembly"" during its ascent into space, and lost contact with the ground. The massive SpaceX Starship, the largest rocket ever created, spun out of control shortly after its launch. No injuries or damage have been reported but images from those in Caribbean Sea island nations show fiery debris raining from the sky. This was the eighth mission to test the rocket, and its second consecutive failure. The spaceship, which measures 123m (403ft) at takeoff, was meant to re-enter Earth's orbit over the Indian Ocean after a one-hour flight. Its Super Heavy booster, which helps it leave the ground, did manage successfully to return to the launchpad. SpaceX, which is owned by billionaire Elon Musk, said teams immediately started co-ordinating with safety officials for ""pre-planned contingency responses"". The statement added that SpaceX would review data ""to better understand [the] root cause"" of the misfire and noted the explosion happened after the loss of ""several"" engines. ""As always, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will offer additional lessons to improve Starship's reliability."" The statement says debris should have fallen within a pre-planned area and the rocket did not contain any toxic materials. The company also included an email and phone number for those who believe they've found any remnants of the craft. Musk has yet to comment on Thursday's explosion. The accident briefly halted flights at several Florida airports, including in Miami and Orlando, over concerns about flaming debris. A statement from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the flights in and out of airports were delayed due to a ""space launch incident"". The incident follows a test in January, which saw a Starship rocket fail minutes after launching from SpaceX's Texas facility. The FAA also briefly closed airports two months ago, due to the same concerns about falling debris. After January's incident, the FAA grounded Starship launches and noted the incident had led to property damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. ""Unfortunately this happened last time too, so we have some practice at this now,"" SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot told reporters at the launch site on Thursday. This latest Starship launch was conducted before the FAA finished investigating January's explosion, according to US media reports. A statement issued from the government of the Turks and Caicos said they were in contact with US authorities and SpaceX and would ""continue to keep the public apprised as we work to ensure the safety and security of our Islands"". Footage posted on X purported to show flaming rocket debris falling over the Caribbean Sea. In the Bahamas, people posted that they were seeking shelter in order to take cover from debris. Starship is the biggest, most powerful rocket ever built, and is key to Musk's ambitions for colonising Mars. SpaceX's Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket - collectively referred to as Starship - is intended to be fully reusable, the company says. Nasa hopes to use a modified version of the spaceship as a human lunar lander for its Artemis missions to return to the Moon. In the more distant future, Musk wants Starship to make long-haul trips to Mars and back - about a nine-month trip each way.",2025-03-07T04:03:55.426Z,Max Matza
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz48ydxm9o,Adnan Syed will not serve more jail time in Serial podcast murder case,"Adnan Syed, whose criminal conviction was made famous in the hit true-crime podcast Serial, will not have to serve any additional jail time after being resentenced in the murder of his ex-girlfriend. A Baltimore judge ruled that Syed ""is not a danger to the public"", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News, and that ""the interests of justice will be served better by a reduced sentence"". Syed was convicted in the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee and sentenced to life in prison. His case spawned the Serial podcast, which questioned key evidence in the case and helped lead to his resentencing. Syed's conviction in the murder case still stands. His resentencing was possible under a law that allows for sentence reductions for people convicted as minors and have spent more than 20 years in prison. Baltimore City Circuit Judge Jennifer Schiffer made the ruling in court on Tuesday. Syed and Min Lee were classmates in high school in Maryland when Lee disappeared in January 1999. Her body was found in a forest three weeks later. Syed, then 17, was found guilty of first degree murder in February 2000, and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors at the time alleged Syed carried out the crime after becoming jealous of Lee's new relationship after the two broke up. In 2014, Syed's case gained national attention through the true-crime podcast 'Serial', which was listened to by millions of people. The podcast raised questions about the evidence provided by prosecutors and witnesses that appeared at his trial, and it explored the effectiveness of Syed's attorney. Fans of the podcast have donated more than $80,000 to Syed's legal fund, according to CBS News. Syed was cleared of all charges in 2022 after prosecutors said he had been wrongfully convicted. But his conviction was reinstated a year later in 2023 after an appeals court found that the lower court had failed to give the victim's brother sufficient notice of the hearing that freed Syed. Judge Schiffer's ruling on Tuesday allows for Syed to remain free. Now 43, he has been out of prison since 2022.",2025-03-07T03:02:01.079Z,Ali Abbas Ahmadi
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz03ye4j8rzo,California governor says trans athletes in female sports 'deeply unfair',"California Governor Gavin Newsom has broken with many elected Democrats by saying he thinks it is ""deeply unfair"" to allow transgender women and girls to compete in female sports. Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential contender who leads one of the most liberal states in the US and has long been a trailblazer on LGBT rights, made the comments on his new podcast. ""I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that,"" Newsom told conservative figure Charlie Kirk. ""It is an issue of fairness, it's deeply unfair. We've got to own that. We've got to acknowledge it."" Newsom's change of tone comes amid a debate within his party over the extent to which cultural factors played a role in their resounding defeat in November, when Republicans won the White House and both chambers of Congress. A number of Democrats quickly denounced the governor's comments. ""We woke up profoundly sickened and frustrated by these remarks,"" a statement from California's LGBT legislative caucus read. On the debut episode of the governor's podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, his first guest was a pro-Trump activist whose Turning Point USA organisation advocates for conservative ideas on liberal-leaning college campuses. The two discussed why Democratic nominee Kamala Harris lost to President Donald Trump, and Newsom said his party was being politically ""crushed"" on transgender issues. The governor referred to a viral Trump campaign ad that had the tagline: ""Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you."" ""It was devastating,"" Newsom said. ""And she didn't even react to it, which was even more devastating."" Kirk argued that Democrats were out of touch with everyday Americans because of broad support within the party for transgender athletes competing in sports, which he said was unfair. ""I revere sports,"" said Newsom. ""So, the issue of fairness is completely legit."" The governor added: ""The way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with, as well."" Former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called Newsom's remarks about trans athletes ""disgusting"". Pramila Jayapal, a left-wing Democrat representing a district in the north-western state of Washington, told Politico that her party should not ""take the bait and give into their anti-trans people rhetoric"". But one moderate Democratic lawmaker agreed. Seth Moulton, of Massachusetts, told Politico that Newsom was correct and polling shows it. ""More and more are willing to say what they've probably always thought - and that's a good thing,"" he said. According to an opinion survey in January by the New York Times/Ipsos, almost all Republicans and nearly seven in 10 Democrats oppose allowing transgender female athletes to participate in women's sports. Throughout his career, Newsom has positioned himself to the left of his party on LGBT rights. He made headlines in 2004 as San Francisco mayor when he ordered the city clerk to issue same-sex marriage licences, which at the time wasn't allowed under state or federal law. Newsom made the state the first sanctuary for transgender youth and protected school curriculums that included LGBT history. Last year he signed legislation that made California the first state to bar school districts from requiring staff to notify parents if their child changed gender identity.",2025-03-07T01:18:16.129Z,Christal Hayes
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyjkn729gpo,US lost a fifth of its butterflies within two decades,"Butterfly populations in the US shrank by more than a fifth within the space of two decades, according to a new study. Numbers fell by 22% between 2000 and 2020, according to research by Binghamton University in New York. A third of species saw serious decline, with some, like Julia's Skipper, losing more than 90% of their populations. However, the researchers say butterflies may be able to recover if urgent conservation measures are taken. The study published in the journal Science measured butterfly ""abundance"" - the number of individuals of a species within a specific area. It analysed 12.6 million butterfly sightings from 76,000 surveys across 35 monitoring programmes. This included data from citizen science programmes like the North American Butterfly Association's Fourth of July counts. Using statistical models, they estimated population trends for 342 species. The results showed that 33% were in significant decline, with many exhibiting extreme losses - 107 species declined by more than 50%. ""While the results aligned with global trends, seeing the extent of the decline at such a large spatial scale was sobering,"" said Prof Eliza Grames, an assistant professor of biological sciences at Binghamton University. Some of the most affected species include the Florida white, Hermes copper, tailed orange, Mitchell's satyr, and West Virginia white, all of which have declined in abundance by more than 98% within the US. The West Coast lady, once a common backyard butterfly, has declined by 80%, raising alarm as even this highly adaptable species struggled. ""That's alarming because it suggests even common butterflies aren't safe,"" Prof Grames said. Habitat loss, pesticides, and climate change are key causes of this decline, according to the researchers. Butterflies are crucial pollinators, supporting plants and crops. Experts say their decline could disrupt food production and entire ecosystems. They also serve as indicators of environmental health - when butterfly numbers fall, it signals trouble for other species. Species are declining most severely in the US Southwest, one of the hottest and driest regions, researchers say. They believe drought may be a major contributor to these losses. ""Drought is a double threat - it harms butterflies directly and also affects their food and host plants,"" Prof Grames explained. The results could help drive important conservation efforts, such as prioritising species for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species and Endangered Species Act protection. Despite the decline, there is hope for recovery. ""Butterflies can recover quickly because they have short generation times. Small actions like planting wildflowers, reducing pesticide use, or even leaving part of a backyard unmowed can significantly improve their chances,"" Prof Grames said. She also stressed the need for government action. ""Insects are fundamental to life on earth, and we need conservation actions and policies that support insects.""",2025-03-06T19:06:06.000Z,Maddie Molloy

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79zxzj90nno,What does the Department of Education do - and can Trump dismantle it?,"President Donald Trump is considering an executive order that would shut down the US Department of Education - a long-cherished goal of conservatives. The move would deliver on a promise he made on the campaign trail. Trump plans to end some of the department's programmes, while others would be housed within different parts of the government, according to US media reports. The Republican president will direct his newly confirmed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to ""take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Education Department"" based on ""the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law"", according to a draft of the order seen by the Wall Street Journal. Abolishing the department entirely requires an act of Congress, however. Established in 1979, the Department of Education oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students. Trump and his allies have accused the agency of ""indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material"". In December, he nominated former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO and his transition co-chair, Linda McMahon, as his pick for education secretary. A common misconception is that the Department of Education operates US schools and sets curricula - that responsibility actually belongs to states and local districts. The agency does oversee student loan programmes and administers Pell grants that help low-income students attend university. It also helps fund programmes to support students with disabilities and for students living in poverty. And the department enforces civil rights law designed to prevent race or sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools. The department's allocation was $238bn (£188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget. The agency says it has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department. Most public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments. In 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil. On his own, no. Not only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of the department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US Senate - 60 out of 100 senators. Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would need at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political longshot. Even in the House of Representatives, Trump would struggle to gain necessary support. A vote last year to abolish the education department - which was attached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans joined all Democrats in the House to vote no. Trump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent weeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves. An earlier draft of Trump's order to dismantle the education department, obtained last month by the Washington Post, acknowledged that only Congress can get rid of the agency outright, but executive action could direct the agency to begin to wind itself down. Education department employees are among those who are the focus of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce. The idea of eliminating the education department has been floated by Republicans for nearly as long as it has existed. During Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, he pushed for it to be dismantled. Republicans have historically pushed against centralising education policy, believing that it is best left up to individual states and localities. More recently they have accused the education department of pushing what they describe as ""woke"" political ideology on to children, including on gender and race. Trump's allies also want to expand school choice, which would allow students and families to use public money to select private or religious alternatives to public schools. Conservatives argue that other education department functions, such as administering loans, should be handled instead by the US Department of Treasury, and that civil rights infractions are the Department of Justice's domain.",2025-03-06T10:02:24.444Z,Ana Faguy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y071kxwn8o,US top court rejects Trump bid to withhold $2bn in foreign aid,"The US Supreme Court has rejected a request by the Trump administration to withhold nearly $2bn (£1.6bn) in payments to foreign aid organisations for work they have already performed for the government. On Wednesday, the top court upheld a lower court ruling ordering the administration to release the funds to contractors and grant recipients of the US Agency for International Development and the State Department. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has cut numerous aid programmes and placed most USAID staff on leave or dismissed them. Aid agencies argue these actions have jeopardised life-saving operations worldwide. Last month District Judge Amir Ali had ordered the State Department and USAID to pay the bills to contractors for the work already done by midnight on 26 February. As the deadline approached, the Trump administration sought an emergency relief from the Supreme Court, arguing it was impossible to process claims in an orderly fashion in such a short period of time. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a brief administrative stay, before the full court acted on President Trump's request. On Wednesday, the top court in a narrow 5-4 decision declined to halt the lower court order that required the Trump administration to release the payment. The court said that Judge Ali's deadline for the immediate payment had now passed, and the district court should ""clarify what obligations"" the administration must fulfil to comply the order. Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented with the order. ""Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?"" Justice Alito wrote in a dissent joined by the three other conservative justices. ""The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned."" The case began when two aid groups challenged Trump's 90-day freeze on foreign assistance. Judge Ali initially paused the cuts while reviewing the case, later ordering payment for completed work after the government failed to comply. Legal proceedings continue, with a district court hearing set for Thursday on contractors' requests for extended relief. The Trump administration, led by billionaire Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiative, aims to shrink the federal workforce. USAID cutbacks have already disrupted global aid efforts, freezing hundreds of programmes in dozens of countries. The US, by far the world's largest humanitarian aid provider, operates in over 60 countries, largely through contractors.",2025-03-05T16:55:26.352Z,Nadine Yousif
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg198xxy1xo,Canada foreign minister takes Trump 51st state line 'very seriously',"Canada's Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly has told the BBC she takes US President Donald Trump's remarks on making Canada the 51st state of his country ""very seriously"". ""This is not a joke anymore,"" Joly told Newsnight. ""There's a reason why Canadians, when they go out on a hockey game, are booing the American national anthem... We're insulted. We're mad. We're angry."" Her comments come after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on products entering the US from Canada on Tuesday. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called that a ""very dumb thing to do"" and announced retaliatory tariffs. However, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump would ""probably"" announce a deal to reduce tariffs on Wednesday. In response, Joly told the BBC that ""at the end of the day, the only one that really takes a decision is President Trump"". She said no Trump administration secretaries had contacted their Canadian counterparts on Monday or Tuesday about tariffs. Trump and Trudeau, however, are expected to speak over the phone on Wednesday morning, according to sources who spoke to CNN and the Toronto Star. Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on 4 February, but delayed implementation until 4 March. Canadian energy imports face a 10% tariff. Ontario Premier Doug Ford implemented a 25% surcharge on electricity exports to three US states, and if tariffs escalated, said he would consider cutting Michigan, New York and Minnesota off from Canadian power. Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on goods worth more than $800 (£645) from China in February, which doubled in March. China responded with its own tariffs. The White House said when it introduced the tariffs that it was ""taking bold action to hold [the three countries] accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country"". Fentanyl is linked to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the US each year. Trudeau said his country was responsible for less than 1% of fentanyl entering the US. Canada had introduced new border security measures in December, in response to Trump's tariff threats before he took office. ""We didn't want this trade war. We did everything that was required under the executive order to make sure our border was safe and secure,"" Joly told the BBC, but said ""this is a bogus excuse on the part of the Trump administration against us"". Joly said Canada was the ""canary in the coal mine"", with the Europeans next, and the UK after that. Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on the European Union as well. She said Canada and the UK should work together: ""That's also why I went to London to make sure that if there are tariffs imposed, we should work on counter-tariffs well."" Joly said Canada's public displays of displeasure against the US are not ""against the American people. We're the best friends of the American people"". She called the tariffs on the US's biggest trading partner an ""existential threat"". ""We cannot let our guard down,"" she said. ""We need to make sure that we fight back.""",2025-03-05T14:40:55.644Z,Mallory Moench
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3ylpd2n9no,Fact-checking Trump's address to Congress,"In his address to Congress, which ran for more than an hour and a half, President Donald Trump made a series of claims about the state of the US under his predecessor Joe Biden and the achievements of his first weeks in office. He returned to key campaign themes including illegal immigration, rising prices and what he called ""appalling waste"" in government spending. BBC Verify has looked into the facts behind some of his key claims. Trump said he inherited an ""economic catastrophe"" from Biden. This is misleading. The US economy was growing at an annual rate of 2.3% in the final quarter of 2024 under the previous administration. It expanded by 2.8% over 2024 as a whole according to official US statistics. The International Monetary Fund estimates that the US growth rate in 2024 was faster than any other nation in the G7. On rising prices, Trump added ""we suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country"". Inflation under Biden peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 - the highest level since 1981 - so not quite as far back as Trump claimed. The 2022 peak was in the context of high inflation in the rest of the world in the wake of the Covid pandemic and a global energy shock. The inflation rate had dropped to 3% by the time Trump took office. Inflation has also been much higher than 9% at several other points in US history, including the 1940s and 1920s. Trump went on to blame Biden for egg prices, claiming he ""let the price of eggs get out of control"". Prices are high, but this has been linked to a bird flu outbreak in the US. Egg prices rose under Biden in 2023, and in January a dozen eggs averaged over $5, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). That is 53% above the average for the whole of 2024. The USDA has said a bird flu outbreak has led to US farmers having to kill millions of chickens, creating egg shortages, and has announced a $1bn (£780m) plan to help combat the issue. The outbreak started in February 2022 and last year the Biden administration allocated more than $800m to tackle it. The Trump administration recently fired a number of USDA officials who worked on the government's response to bird flu as part of cost-cutting measures by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). They are now reportedly attempting to rehire some of them. Trump praised Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) and claimed the advisory body had found ""hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud"" in federal government spending. No evidence has been provided for this figure. On its official website, Doge states that it has saved an estimated $105bn, from fraud detection, contract and grant cancellations, real estate lease terminations, asset sales, workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings. However, that figure cannot be independently verified as, so far, Doge has only published ""receipts"" for contract, grant and real estate lease cancellations on the website. These add up to about $18.6bn. We have asked the White House for evidence of the remaining $86bn of savings. US media outlets have also highlighted some accounting errors. For example, Doge initially listed its largest saving of $8bn from scrapping an immigration agency contract - it later corrected this to $8m. Speaking about his actions to tackle illegal immigration, Trump said that ""as a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded"". This is true. In February 2025, 8,326 encounters of migrants at the south-west border with Mexico were recorded by US Border Patrol. This is the lowest level since monthly records began in 2000. By comparison, there were 140,641 encounters by US Border Patrol at this border in February last year under Biden. Numbers fell to 47,316 in December 2024. Continuing with illegal migration, Trump claimed: ""Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States"". There is no evidence for a figure this high. Encounters with migrants at the borders - a measure of illegal migration - reached 10 million under Biden but this does not mean this many people stayed in the US. It is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Trump stated. A report published by the Office of Homeland Security last year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million. It says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s. On US aid to Ukraine, Trump claimed: ""We've spent perhaps $350bn… and they [Europe] have spent $100bn. What a difference that is."" BBC Verify is unable to find any evidence for Trump's $350bn claim and some figures suggest Europe has spent more as whole when all aid to Ukraine is included. The US is, by some margin, the largest single donor to Ukraine. But Europe combined has spent more money than the US, according to the Kiel Institute think tank. It calculates that between 24 January 2022 and the end of 2024, Europe as a whole spent $138.7bn on Ukraine, while the US spent $119.7bn. The US Department of Defense has a higher figure of $182.8bn - taking into account a broader range of US military activity in Europe - but this is still considerably less than Trump's figure. We have asked the White House where it comes from. Correction: an earlier version of this article stated that migrant encounters at the south-west border fell to 96,000 at the end of 2024. While this is correct for overall encounters here, the number recorded by Border Patrol was 47,316. Additional reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh & Anthony Reuben.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y07glyge3o,Democrat Al Green ejected from chamber for heckling Trump,"Representative Al Green was ejected from the House chamber for heckling President Donald Trump during his joint address to Congress on Tuesday night. Green, a Democratic lawmaker from Houston in Texas, stood up and shouted 'Mr President, you don't have a mandate!' just minutes into Trump's address, referring to Medicaid cuts. He was immediately drowned out by Republicans shouting ""U-S-A!,"" before House Speaker Mike Johnson ordered his removal from the chamber. Green is a fierce critic of President Trump, and called for the impeachment of the president during his first term in office. Speaking to reporters after he left the chamber, Green said he is willing to accept whatever punishment he is given for his actions. He doubled down on his message, saying Trump ""has no mandate to cut Medicaid"", and that he is preparing articles to impeach the president. ""This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. We've got to do better and now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for [the] poor,"" he said. Medicaid is the programme that helps cover medical costs for those with limited income and resources. It has become one of the biggest issues for Democrats concerned that about reductions to the programme. Trump has said Medicaid won't be affected, but achieving the widespread cuts Republicans promise could be difficult without cutting major social services. Several prominent Democrats such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer invited Medicaid beneficiaries as guests to the joint address. New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went on Instagram Live after Trump's address, warning that Trump and the Republicans ""are coming for Medicaid"". Green was not the only Democrat who protested in the chamber. Several Democratic women were seen wearing pink dresses in protest of President Trump's policies, saying that rising costs are disproportionately affecting women. Others were seen wearing yellow and blue ties, to show their support for Ukraine, representing the colours of the country's flag. Trump said Monday that he is pausing all military aid to Ukraine, a few days after his spat with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. The Democrats largely remained seated and quiet throughout Trump's address, but some flashed placards with the word 'false' on them in response to some of the president's claims.

Charges against them include child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy, and battery, attorney general Rob Bonta's office announced in a press release on Monday. Officials tallied 69 fights at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, California, from July to December 2023. An investigation into the brawls began after footage from one of the fights was leaked, leading officials to find 143 victims involved, ranging from 12 to 18 years old. Twenty-two of the 30 officers charged were arraigned on Monday, meaning they formally faced their charges in court. The other eight officers are scheduled to be arraigned in April. ""Officers at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of those under their care,"" Mr Bonta said in the press release. Instead, he continued, the officers charged were ""overseeing 'gladiator fights' when they should have intervened"". The fights at the youth centre resulted in physical harm to the teens, according to the press release. The leaked video footage - published by the Los Angeles Times in April - shows a teen falling to the ground after sustaining punches and kicks from multiple others. The video shows officers inside standing nearby and watching, and they appear to occasionally laugh and shake hands with the assailants as the fights continue. ""Watching the video, the officers look more like referees or audience members at a prizefight, not adults charged with the care and supervision of young people,"" Mr Bonta said at a press conference on Monday. ""The officers don't step in, don't intervene and don't protect their charges."" The LA County Probation Department, which runs Los Padrinos, said in a statement that it ""fully supports and applauds"" the attorney general's office for the indictments. The department also said that all officers involved are on leave without pay. ""Our department sought the assistance of law enforcement authorities when misconduct was discovered,"" the statement said. ""Since then, we have fully collaborated with our law enforcement partners. At least two of the teens involved have retained a lawyer with plans to sue the county, according to the New York Times. One of the two teens was seen being attacked in the video footage, aged 16 at the time, said the teen's lawyer, Jamal Tooson.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn07dv4mrg2o,JD Vance: The 'hillbilly' Maga loyalist who became vice-president,"US Vice-President JD Vance is no stranger to transformation. Vance grew up in poverty, but went on to Yale Law School and rubbed shoulders with Silicon Valley elites before turning his life story into a politically tinged memoir which championed conservative values. He is a former US Marine who served in Iraq as a military journalist before becoming a sharp critic of American involvement overseas. And having once said he was a ""never-Trump guy"", he took office as Trump's deputy - and a steadfast Maga (Make America Great Again) loyalist. His current job also makes him the early frontrunner in the 2028 presidential race, when Trump will no longer be able to run under rules set out in the US Constitution. Trump, 78, is the oldest person ever to be sworn in as US president, and 40-year-old Vance is - as an old phrase goes - just a heartbeat away from the top job. But now the former Ohio Senator and self-described ""hillbilly"" faces perhaps his biggest test - keeping in with Trump and forging a role in the administration when Elon Musk has sucked up much more attention than the president's elected second-in-command. The pitfalls are obvious. The last Republican Vice-President, Mike Pence, dared to stand up to Trump by refusing to overturn the duo's 2020 election loss. Pence's subsequent bid to run for president crashed and burned, and he is now persona non grata in the Maga world. Vance will hope to avoid the same fate. And his recent lecturing of US allies - including a fiery confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office - point to a possible role he may fill as vice-president, that of an aggressive champion of ""America first"" foreign policy. Vance was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler. He was raised by his grandparents, “Mamaw” and “Papaw”, whom he sympathetically portrayed in Hillbilly Elegy, published in 2016. A revolving cast of father figures - he changed his surname several times - and his mother's drug abuse issues resulted in a chaotic childhood, and he found refuge in Mamaw's house. When he married, both JD and his wife Usha took the last name of Vance to honour his maternal grandparents' family name - leading to his current name: James David Vance. Middletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, but Vance identified closely with his extended family’s roots to the south. Appalachia is a vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest and north-east. Largely but not exclusively white, it includes some of the country’s poorest areas, where jobs are scarce and drugs and violence are abundant. In Hillbilly Elegy, Vance painted a personal portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of family members, neighbours and friends. While criticising outsiders for looking down on the ""hillbillies"" of the book's title, he took a distinctly conservative view, describing his own people as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on government welfare payments and mostly failing to work hard and pull themselves up by their tattered bootstraps. He wrote that he saw Appalachians “reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible” and that they were products of “a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it”. “The truth is hard,” he wrote, “and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.” By the time the book came out - with near-perfect timing in the thick of the 2016 presidential race - Vance’s own bootstrap-tugging had slung him far away from Middletown. His stint in the US Marines including a tour of duty in Iraq was followed by college at Ohio State University and Yale Law School, then a job as a venture capitalist in California. Hillbilly Elegy not only made him into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump’s appeal to white, working-class voters. His verdict on Trump was damning - and definitive. Some quotes from the time: “I’m a 'never Trump' guy. I never liked him.” “My god what an idiot.” “I find him reprehensible.” As he promoted his book, and along with it a mix of sympathy for the working class and conservative values, Vance rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee. “I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class,"" he told an interviewer in October 2016. ""What it’s doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.” Ironically, those are exactly some of the themes that he himself would go on to regularly raise eight years later, as Trump's running mate. Vance and his wife Usha, who he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel. Usha Vance had a posher upbringing than her husband, growing up in a suburb of San Diego as the child of Indian immigrant academics. In addition to her Yale history and law degrees, she has a master's from the UK's University of Cambridge. She served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and most recently worked for Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that a leading legal journal described as ""progressive"" and ""woke"". Mrs Vance resigned from her job shortly after her husband was selected by Trump to be the VP nominee. In 2017, in the early years of the first Trump term, Vance and his family returned to Ohio after several years of living on the US coasts. At the same time, whispers about Vance's possible foray into politics - bolstered by his newfound fame - grew. And several years later, Vance saw an opportunity when Ohio’s Republican Senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022. Although his campaign was initially slow to get going, it got a kick-start via a $10m (£7.7m) donation from his former boss, Silicon Valley powerbroker Peter Thiel. His rhetoric shifted, and he spent less time talking about the failures of hillbillies and more about those of elites, the ""woke"" and Democrats. He began appearing on Fox News, but to drum up support, he also popped up on fringier political outlets - including the right-wing Newsmax network and niche podcasts and YouTube channels. Many of the controversial clips which would later resurface during the 2024 presidential campaign date from around the time his Senate campaign was starting to gain traction. At one point he told then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the United States was being run by ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too."" Vance later called his remark ""dumb"" but said he was trying to make the point that ""our country has become almost pathologically anti-child"". However the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected to the Senate was his past criticism of Trump. Vance remained a Trump sceptic as late as 2020, according to text messages obtained by the Washington Post. Then, he wrote that the president had ""thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism (excepting a disjointed China policy)"". And he correctly predicted that Trump would lose the presidency - although he would later endorse false claims that Trump actually beat Joe Biden. Eventually, though, he found himself on a path back to Maga. During the 2022 Senate campaign, Vance apologised for his previous public criticism of Trump and earned an endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate. During his short tenure in the Senate, Vance was a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine - a role he would continue to play in the second Trump administration. Democrats were in the majority during his time in Congress, muffling any impact that a freshman Republican senator might hope to have, however Vance proposed legislation to withhold federal funds from colleges that allow protests against Israel's war in Gaza or employ undocumented immigrants. At a speech in July 2024 at the National Conservatism Conference, an increasingly influential gathering of right-wing and far-right leaders from around the world, he argued that American involvement in Ukraine had ""no obvious conclusion or even objective that we’re close to getting accomplished"". At the same conference, he said the UK was ""not doing so good"" because of immigration and claimed that under a Labour government, the country would become the “first truly Islamist country” with a nuclear bomb. Just days later, during the Republican National Convention, Trump tapped Vance for the VP nomination. He received a rapturous welcome when he entered the venue in Milwaukee, appearing slightly in awe as he was greeted by the party faithful. Once out on the campaign trail, he established himself as an attack dog, relentlessly criticising the opposition and engaging with reporters in combative Q&A sessions at rallies and on cable TV shows. He continued to attract controversy, spreading baseless rumours about Haitian immigrants eating pets, which caused huge upheaval in Springfield, a city not far from Vance's hometown in Ohio. During a CNN interview, Vance explained that he felt the need to ""create stories so that the... media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people”. He insisted that constituents had told him stories of pet-eating by immigrants, even though he did not elaborate and his Senate office did not respond to the BBC's requests for details. He also shifted his views on abortion policy. A Catholic convert, Vance had at one time expressed support for a nationwide abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy. He later backed Trump's view that the matter should be left up to individual states to decide. During the whirlwind first weeks of Trump's second term, Vance gave staunch backing for his boss's plans to reshape and scale back government - and questioned the authority of US judges to stand in the way. But Vance was often overshadowed by Trump's cost-cutting tsar Elon Musk and his attempts to take a wrecking ball to multiple government departments. The vice-president has had more of an impact on foreign policy. He made his debut on the world stage with a trip to Europe, during which he berated US allies at the Munich Security Conference. Vance accused European leaders of censoring free speech, taking in too many immigrants and undermining democracy. Then in late February came the argument in the Oval Office, during a meeting that went off the rails after Vance interjected to praise Trump's diplomacy and slam the previous Democratic administration. Zelensky replied by outlining the recent decade including repeated Russian violations of ceasefire agreements and pointedly asked the vice-president: ""What kind of diplomacy, JD, [are] you are speaking about?"" The conversation devolved from there, with Vance accusing Zelensky of disrespect. ""Have you said thank you once?"" Vance demanded, as the Ukrainian president pointed out that he had thanked Americans on numerous occasions. It was a return to Vance's loyal attack-dog style seen on the campaign trail. As for the future, Trump was asked in a February interview broadcast before the Super Bowl if he viewed Vance as his successor. ""No,"" Trump said, before explaining that at this stage, the Republican 2028 field is still wide open. ""But he's very capable… it's too early, we're just starting."" The reward for Vance's loyalty could be huge. But the vice-presidency is no sure ticket to the top job. Just ask Kamala Harris – or Mike Pence.",2025-03-04T20:25:36.863Z,Mike Wendling
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqly0zrnnv3o,Trump vows to deport students over 'illegal protests',"US President Donald Trump said he would cut funding for universities that allow what he called ""illegal"" protests and prosecute and deport foreign students who participate. On his Truth Social social media platform, Trump said that ""all federal funding will STOP"" for schools that permit students to protest illegally. Trump's announcement comes less than a year after massive student protests against Israel's war in Gaza swept across US college campuses, including Columbia University in New York and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). American students will be expelled, Trump said. Trump did not specify what would constitute an ""illegal"" protest. Broadly speaking, the right to protest is protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution. The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also known as Fire, swiftly condemned Trump's announcement. ""Colleges can and should respond to unlawful conduct, but the president does not have unilateral authority to revoke federal funds, even for colleges that allow 'illegal' protests,"" the statement said. The group added that the move will ""cast an impermissible chill on student protests about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict"". In a separate announcement, the US Department of Education, General Services Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services said they would conduct a ""comprehensive review"" of Columbia's federal contracts amid an ongoing investigation into compliance with Title VI, a federal law that bans discrimination based on ethnicity or ancestry. In a statement, the education department said that it is considering stop work orders for $51.4m (£40.19m) in contracts with the New York City-based university, and will review more than $5bn in grant commitments to the school. ""Americans have watched in horror for more than a year now, as Jewish students have been assaulted and harassed on elite university campuses - repeatedly overrun by antisemitic students and agitators,"" Trump's new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, said in a statement. McMahon added that ""unlawful encampments and demonstrations have completely paralysed day-to-day campus operations, depriving Jewish students of learning opportunities to which they are entitled"". In January, Trump signed an executive order that called for the removal of foreign students who participated in protests. The order also directed government departments to make recommendations that could allow educational institutions to ""monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff"" and, if warranted, remove them. A White House fact sheet on the order specified that it seeks to ""protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities"". In April 2024, student protests against the war in Gaza drew national attention after students at Columbia were arrested at a student encampment set up on campus. Thousands of arrests were ultimately made at dozens of universities across the country. At Columbia, the university authorised New York Police Department officers to swarm the campus, a controversial decision that led to the arrests of about 100 students who were occupying a university building. Four months after protests rocked the campus, Columbia president Minouche Shafik resigned. Earlier this week, a federal task force announced it would visit 10 prominent US universities that have been the scene of anti-semitic incidents.",2025-03-04T20:18:46.164Z,Bernd Debusmann Jr
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d81pdmnm8o,Ontario's Doug Ford says he could cut electricity to US over tariffs,"Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he's willing to cut off power supply to the US if President Donald Trump continues with tariffs against Canada. Ford announced his retaliatory plans shortly after Trump implemented a 25% tariff against Canadian imported goods and a 10% tariff on Canadian energy. He said he would implement his own 25% surcharge on Canadian electricity exports to three US states: Michigan, New York and Minnesota. If the US tariffs are escalated, he said, he would consider completely cutting those states off from Canadian power. About 1.5m Americans in those states get their electricity from Canada. Ford's response comes after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his own retaliatory measures – including an immediate 25% tariff on C$30bn ($20.7, £16.2) of goods from the US. As the leader of Ontario, Canada's most populous province and largest economy, Ford is able to wield his own carrot and stick. He banned US companies from bidding on Ontario infrastructure projects, and he cancelled a $100m deal with Elon Musk's Starlink internet provider. He also said he's reached out to lawmakers in those three US states to urge them to put pressure on Trump to back off tariffs against Canada - or risk leaving their own constituents in the dark. He also urged premiers in other Canadian provinces to follow suit. But the timing of Ford's promised tariffs is not clear. Ford told media he would implement the tariff on electricity if Trump's tariffs ""persist"". He said he is looking for ways to avoid passing new legislation, which could take weeks. ""We need to act immediately,"" he said. ""If they go further into April, then we'll cut off their electricity,"" he added.",2025-03-04T19:54:15.771Z,Robin Levinson King
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y08ye0xm2o,Jay-Z sues woman who dropped rape claim against him,"Jay-Z is suing a woman who in February withdrew her legal action accusing the rapper of rape. His defamation action claims she ""voluntarily admitted"" being pressured into making false claims in what it describes as an ""evil conspiracy"" to extort money and damage his reputation. The anonymous woman filed her legal action in October and refiled it in December, accusing Jay-Z, real name Shawn Carter, and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of raping her aged 13, after the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Both rappers denied the allegations. Jay-Z's defamation action, filed at a federal court in Alabama, also accuses the woman's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, and his co-counsel, David Fortney, of orchestrating her lawsuit. Mr Buzbee has garnered headlines internationally over the dozens of legal actions he has filed on behalf of people accusing Mr Combs of sexual misconduct, extortion, assault and other transgressions. Mr Combs has denied all the allegations. He is also facing federal sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Jay-Z's defamation action says the woman told his legal team her lawyers had made her make the false allegations. ""Buzbee brought Jay-Z into it,"" it says she said. And despite her admitting Jay-Z ""did not sexually assault [her],"" Mr Buzbee ""pushed [her] towards going forward"" with the false story to strengthen the case and extort more money, the defamation suit claims. Jay-Z's action also notes alleged discrepancies in the woman's interview with NBC News last year, including naming another celebrity guest at the MTV party, who had, in reality, been performing in a city thousands of miles away on the night. Her father also contradicted her claim he had picked her up after the alleged assault, it claims. Jay-Z's defamation action says Mr Buzbee's firm failed to vet the claims and the woman, who they say has a history of mental health issues and an assault charge. Mr Buzbee has denied any wrongdoing and claims Jay-Z's team tried to intimidate the woman into retracting her statements. In a statement obtained by BBC News, Mr Buzbee said Jay-Z's defamation action had ""no legal merit"". ""Shawn Carter's investigators have repeatedly harassed, threatened and harangued this poor woman for weeks, trying to intimidate her and make her recant her story,"" Mr Buzbee said. ""She won't - instead, she has stated repeatedly she stands by her claims."" Jay- Z, who is married to Beyoncé, says the accusations have led to personal and professional harm, including the loss of business contracts worth about $20m (£15.8m) a year for his company, Roc Nation, and taken an emotional toll on his family, particularly his children.",2025-03-04T18:50:45.255Z,Samantha Granville
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg17jmm5vxo,'It never should have happened': Americans frustrated by Trump-Zelensky spat,"The shocking blow-up between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday continues to ripple across the globe, including through American voters who expressed frustration at one or both leaders. The extraordinary scene saw Vice-President JD Vance accuse the Ukrainian president of being ""disrespectful"" to the US, while Trump urged him to make a deal with Russia ""or we are out"". Trump also accused the Ukrainian president of ""gambling with World War Three"" as Zelensky pushed back at suggestions that he should work harder to agree a ceasefire with Vladimir Putin. Zelensky was eventually told to leave the White House early. World leaders and elected officials in the US have had much to say about the tense exchange, but so do American voters. We've asked five people what they think. This South Carolina voter aligns himself with the Trump administration but he was frustrated by the Oval Office spat and wants the US to continue to back Ukraine. It never should have happened. I blame both [Zelensky and Trump]. Zelensky did come across as arrogant, frankly. I get he was trying to make his point but he doesn't know how to deal with Trump. [UK Prime Minister Keir] Starmer knows how to deal with Trump, [French Prime Minister Emmanuel] Macron knows how to deal with Trump, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin definitely knows how to deal with Trump, but [Zelensky] doesn't know how to handle Trump. Some of what Trump says is true. When he said Ukraine doesn't have the cards, [Zelensky] doesn't have the cards. But Zelensky does have the cards in so far as saying that we will feel it in America shortly after Europe feels it, if Putin is appeased, because [Putin will] just reconstitute his forces and invade somebody else. This Florida Democrat has repeatedly voted against Trump and said she was ashamed to call herself an American in the wake of the meeting. I had to pause it a couple of times to give myself a few moments to cool off. I saw Trump and Vance steamrolling President Zelensky and refusing to let him get a word in edgewise. They were selfish, rude, callous, and displayed a complete lack of basic human empathy. It's hard to stay optimistic about the outcome of this war, and I knew something like this was likely to happen after Trump was re-elected. I've been dreading this possibility since election day; however, I didn't anticipate Trump being this horrible about it. I'm terrified for Zelensky and Ukraine. If more people had seen the full interaction between Trump and Zelensky, then this Pennsylvania voter says they would understand Trump's frustrations. The majority of the American public is getting a sliver of what happened, I'm glad that was public but I wish people would watch the whole thing because I think they'd have a very different point of view. This war needs to end, but it's not going to end the way Zelensky wants it to end. It's a sad state of affairs. Zelensky was expecting it to go a lot differently and I give Vance and Trump a lot of credit for handling it the way it did. Putin sitting there going, ""Damn, I better behave because Trump is holding no prisoners."" This New Jersey voter has backed both Republicans and Democrats in the past but was ""disgusted"" by how Trump and Vance handled themselves in the Oval Office. I was absolutely disgusted with it. Even if Zelensky and the Ukrainians were considered adversarial to us, you wouldn't talk to their head of state or head of government that way. I would go beyond sending more aid to Ukraine - I would go as far as saying we should send military assets: putting planes in the air or putting boots on the ground. [Putin] operates like a bully. The only way you're really going to get a bully to reconsider their actions is to stand up to them - you have to be willing to punch them in the mouth at some point in time. This Indiana Trump voter wants to help Ukraine, but thinks there should be limit to US generosity to ensure Americans are taken care of too. I want to help them as much as we can but we can't keep giving, giving, giving. Zelensky had good reason to want more, but I feel like he was in the wrong to ask for it in that manner. If he did it in private, it would have been the place for it. I didn't feel like Trump or Vance's reaction to it was wrong. It wasn't perfect, but I don't think it was a bad reaction per se. I hope there can be reconciliation after this, I want to help them end this war. But if there isn't some middle ground they can find, I don't want to see the US to continue to spend and spend on a country that isn't ours when we have domestic problems. This California voter was taken aback by the ""arrogant stance"" of Trump and Vance against Zelensky. All it seemed like Trump and Vance wanted to do was ""make a deal"", in other words turn a profit from this conflict. Ukraine doesn't need trade partners. It needs allies, nations who aren't afraid to put some skin in this fight and fend off an invading enemy. The world's leaders need to take in the full scope of this conflict and stop letting Vladimir Putin dictate the rules of engagement. The war in Ukraine is not some limited regional border dispute. This is a case of full-blown invasion by one sovereign nation of another. The war has gone on long enough for Ukraine to fight it without any other allies fighting alongside them in battle. Ukraine can't and shouldn't fight this war alone. This Indiana voter supports the president but described Trump and Vance's behaviour as the wrong move. In all my years alive, I've never seen anything like that before. I understand behind closed doors things like this happen, but the Oval Office is not where you're displaying your dirty laundry. I'm not a big fan of Zelensky but I found what happened in the Oval Office the other day is embarrassing. It's getting muddled up between the personalities on display there but the fact of the matter is Russia invaded Ukraine not once but twice. Russia is the aggressor. I understand the administration wants to show the world what we're dealing with, but we're supposed to be the leader of the world and good leaders don't lose their cool at this level. I don't want to appear that I'm hostile of Trump, but I just think this style of leadership is not productive.",2025-03-03T19:39:07.720Z,Ana Faguy & Max Matza
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0nlk3vg1lo,Earthquake hits Hollywood as stars gather for Oscars afterparty,"A magnitude 3.9 earthquake has hit Hollywood as some of the globe's top stars began celebrating after the Oscars. The earthquake's epicentre was measured in North Hollywood, just miles from where the awards ceremony was hosted at the Dolby Theatre. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. The quake struck shortly after 22:00 local time as celebrities were gathering at the popular Vanity Fair afterparty. Those in the area reported a sudden jolt of energy, with some screaming and seeing high-rise buildings wobbling like jelly. The US Geological Survey (USGS), which tracks such events, said the earthquake was felt miles across Los Angeles. There was no tsunami alert issued as a result of the relatively minor earthquake. The Los Angeles Fire Department said that the earthquake was felt across downtown Los Angeles but the agency was not entering into ""Earthquake Mode"" over the incident. For stronger earthquakes, first responders and officials do assessments of the area to ensure there is no structural damage to buildings and infrastructure. The quake is among about 40 that have hit Southern California since the start of March - though nearly all of these were magnitude 1 earthquakes that aren't typically felt by residents, according to USGS data reviewed by the BBC. Last month, there was a magnitude 3.7 earthquake that struck the nearby Malibu area. In December, a strong magnitude 7 earthquake jolted northern California and caused a short tsunami alert for those in northern California and southern Oregon. BBC correspondents covering the Academy Awards in the heart of Hollywood reported fierce shaking and even some screams as the sudden jolt scared visitors. To some, it sounded like a bomb went off with the rumble. One resident called it the biggest earthquake she'd felt and was surprised it was only a magnitude 3.9. ""I felt that in my bones,"" she remarked. The BBC's Emma Vardy said she was retouching her makeup for some final Oscars filming when the quake struck. Her rhinestone chandelier earrings wobbled in the mirror and she realised the high-rise she was in was shaking. ""I have felt a lot of quakes over the past two years in Los Angeles but currently, I am on the 15th floor of our media centre in Hollywood,"" she remarked. ""Feeling a building of that size move around like jelly is quite an experience."" Sam Granville and Emma Vardy contributed to this report.",2025-03-03T19:28:09.201Z,Christal Hayes
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78e7gjz387o,Illinois man pleads guilty to 2022 Highland Park mass shooting,"An Illinois man has pleaded guilty to a deadly shooting at a 2022 Independence Day parade in a Chicago suburb that killed seven and injured dozens. It is a surprise reversal for Robert Crimo III, who previously pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and attempted murder charges. Crimo, 23, entered his guilty plea on Monday moments before opening arguments were due to begin in his trial. He is accused of shooting at celebrating crowds from a roof in downtown Highland Park, about 30 miles (50 kilometres) north of Chicago. Authorities had arrested him on the day of the shooting after a manhunt. Crimo pleaded guilty before Judge Victoria Rossetti in a Lake County circuit courtroom, and did not say anything else before he was dismissed. According to the Chicago Tribune, the suspect's mother briefly interrupted after he pleaded guilty, resulting in the judge warning her that she could be kicked out of the courtroom. His trial was expected to last a month, with testimony from survivors and police. Crimo faces seven murder counts and a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole. He is due to be sentenced on 23 April. Prosecutors said they also turned over thousands of pages of evidence, including a videotaped interrogation during which police say the suspect had confessed to the shooting. The victims killed in the shooting were Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; and married couple Kevin McCarthy, 37, and Irina McCarthy, 35. More than 40 others were injured, with victims ages ranging from their 80s to an eight-year-old boy who was left paralysed. Prosecutors during the trial said Crimo had disguised himself in women's clothing before he accessed a rooftop and opened fire on parade-goers. He then left the area, dropping his semi-automatic weapon. Authorities said Crimo had driven for more than two hours to Wisconsin after the shooting before he was caught by police. Police recovered 83 spent shell casings, as well as rifle magazines, from the scene of the shooting.",2025-03-03T17:02:35.831Z,Nadine Yousif
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddy2q2z8dzo,Provocative Trump statements about Canada loom large as Trudeau meets King,"King Charles has met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, under the shadow of inflammatory statements made about Canada by US President Donald Trump. Trump has repeatedly spoken of making the neighbouring country the 51st state of America. He has also vowed to impose new import taxes on Canada, which is one of the US's top trading partners. Ahead of his meeting with the King at Sandringham, outgoing PM Trudeau said he would discuss issues of importance to Canadians, including ""standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation"". The King has also extended an invitation to Trump to visit him in what will be an unprecedented second state visit. As head of state of the Commonwealth nation, the King has faced calls to give Canada his vocal backing in the face of Trump's statements. Jason Kenney, the former leader of the Canadian province of Alberta, suggested Charles faces a difficult tightrope. Jason Kenney, a conservative who served as Alberta's premier, wrote on X that the King could only act on the advice of the Canadian PM, who ""should ask [Charles] to underscore Canadian sovereignty"". But the conservative politician then took aim at British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, whom he said had ""cravenly thrown Canada under the bus"" when he refused to comment on Trump's annexation threats during his visit to the White House last week. ""It was a shameful betrayal of a fellow realm which has made enormous sacrifices for the defence of Britain,"" Kenney wrote. New import taxes announced by Trump are also set to come into effect on Tuesday, targeting goods arriving from China and Mexico as well as Canada. The president is eager to protect American manufacturing and jobs, and to address the US trade deficit. He suggested in a post on his Truth Social platform on Sunday that his country was effectively subsidising Canada by paying to import its products. Without this flow of capital, Canada ""ceases to exist as a viable country"", he wrote. Trump has previously spoken of using ""economic force"" to make Canada the 51st state of America. But he said he was not considering using military force - an assurance he has not given while stating his ambitions of taking the Panama Canal and Greenland. The question of how to respond to Trump's tariff threats and other statements about Canadian sovereignty has dominated the debate in Trudeau's Liberal Party, with candidates vying to replace the PM after he announced his resignation in January. On the other side of the Canadian political divide, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has also attacked Trump's statements. The King has found himself at the centre of a recent whirlwind of diplomatic meetings following Trump's return to the presidency - some of which relate to the war in Ukraine. On Sunday, he also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - who ended up in a row of his own with Trump at the White House on Friday. Zelensky was in the UK to meet European leaders, who reiterated their support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia - with American support apparently on the wane under Trump.",2025-03-03T12:51:10.942Z,James FitzGerald
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0jgggd7r4o,Crypto prices rally after Trump backs five coins for 'crypto reserve',"US President Donald Trump has revealed the names of five cryptocurrencies that he says he'd like to be included in a new strategic reserve to make the US ""the Crypto Capital of the World"". The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano - all swiftly jumped after the announcement. During Trump's presidential campaign, he aggressively courted the crypto community. The previous US president, Joe Biden, had overseen a crackdown on crypto due to concerns about fraud and money laundering. It is unclear how the new stockpile will work. More information is expected on Friday, when Trump plans to host the first Crypto Summit at the White House. In a social media post on Sunday, Trump said he had signed an order which ""directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA"". About an hour later he added in another post: ""And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve."" The first three coins he named jumped by up to 62% on Sunday. Bitcoin and Ethereum also jumped by more than 10% each. The posts marked a new upward turn for crypto prices, which had dropped sharply since spiking after his election. Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations. The order called on the group to ""evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile"" that could use ""cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts"". It is unclear whether creating a new national strategic stockpile would require an act of Congress. Trump had previously been a crypto critic, telling Fox News in 2021 that Bitcoin is a ""scam"". But in recent weeks, both he and his wife Melania Trump have launched their own cryptocurrencies, leading to accusations that they are trying to profit from his White House policies.",2025-03-02T22:29:46.089Z,Max Matza
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kgq5pzpllo,Trump makes English official language of US,"President Donald Trump has signed an executive order making English the official language of the United States. It means government agencies and organisations that receive federal funding can choose whether they want to offer documents and services in languages other than English. It rescinds a policy that required such bodies to provide language assistance to non-English speakers signed by former president Bill Clinton in 2000. ""Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society,"" the order says. This marks the first time the US has designated an official language at the federal level since the country was founded almost 250 years ago. It is noted in the order that agencies do not need to change, remove or stop offering any such assistance they already provide. ""In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream,"" the order reads. ""Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society."" It also says it celebrates the ""long tradition of multilingual American citizens who have learned English and passed it to their children for generations to come"". Nearly 68 million of the country's 340 million residents speak a language other than English, according to the US Census Bureau. This includes more than 160 Native American languages. Spanish, various Chinese languages and Arabic are among the languages spoken the most after English, according to the Census Bureau. Republicans have previously tried to get English designated as the US's official language, with members of the House introducing legislation that failed in 2021. Those who opposed their efforts said an official language was not necessary given the high numbers of people who speak English without it being designated as such. They also said establishing one could promote discrimination against non-English speakers. During his presidential campaign in 2024, Trump referenced non-English languages while calling for stricter immigration policies. ""It's the craziest thing - they have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It's a very horrible thing,"" he told a crowd of supporters in February 2024. Approximately 180 countries around the world have official national languages, and most countries recognise multiple official languages. Several countries do not have an official language, including the United Kingdom. More than 30 US states have designated English as the official language, while Alaska and Hawaii have also given official status to several native languages.",2025-03-02T17:40:38.316Z,Maia Davies
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxqnxw6z73o,Protesters target JD Vance in Vermont after clash with Zelensky,"Protesters in the US have lined a road in Vermont that Vice-President JD Vance was due to drive down following his and President Trump's angry exchange with Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House. They held up pro-Ukraine signs on the route in Waitsfield that Vance and his family were expected to take on their way to go skiing. US media reported the family moved to an undisclosed location from their planned ski resort because of the demonstrations. Hundreds of people also gathered in New York, Los Angeles and Boston on Saturday to express their support for Ukraine - a day after the furious row in the Oval Office. The extraordinary scenes in the Oval Office saw Vance accuse the Ukrainian president of being disrespectful to the US. Trump also clashed with Zelensky, telling him to make a deal with Russia ""or we are out"" and accusing him of ""gambling with World War Three"". A protest in Waitsfield against the Trump-Vance administration had been organised earlier in the week - before the US president and vice-president's clash with Zelensky - but many signs referenced the row and Russia's war with Ukraine. ""I think [Friday's] performance at the White House has probably galvanised even more people to come out today,"" Judy Daly, from Indivisible Mad River Valley, the group which organised the protest, told Vermont Public Radio. ""[Vance] crossed the line,"" protester Cori Giroux added. Ahead of the Vance family's trip, Vermont's governor Phil Scott had urged people to ""be respectful"" to them. Scott, the Republican governor who refused to vote for Trump, said: ""I welcome the vice-president and his family to Vermont and hope they enjoy their weekend here. ""It's no surprise they chose Vermont, we've had a lot of snow this winter, which has been good for our economy."" He added: ""I hope Vermonters remember the vice-president is here on a family trip with his young children and, while we may not always agree, we should be respectful. ""Please join me in welcoming them to Vermont, and hoping they have an opportunity to experience what makes our state, and Vermonters, so special."" Vance, who has three young children with his wife Usha, has not publicly commented on the protests. Counter-protesters supporting Trump and Vance were also reportedly in Waitsfield. Separately, demonstrators also gathered outside Tesla stores in the US on Saturday to protest against Elon Musk's push to slash government spending. Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla, has been tasked by Trump to oversee the Department of Government Efficiency, more popularly known as Doge. After the meeting at the White House, Zelensky flew to the UK where he was welcomed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and on Sunday he joined European leaders and Canada's Justin Trudeau in London for a summit to discuss ways of ending the war in Ukraine and ensuring Europe's security. Ahead of the summit, Starmer said the UK and France would work with Ukraine ""on a plan to stop the fighting"" with Russia and would then ""discuss that plan with the United States"". He told the BBC that his ""driving purpose"" right now was to act as a ""bridge"" between the two men. Asked about how he felt watching the spat in the White House, Starmer sought to play down the incident, saying ""nobody wants to see that"" and admitted he felt ""uncomfortable"".",2025-03-02T15:29:55.905Z,David Mercer
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9208qv1kzo,Private spacecraft Blue Ghost lands on Moon,"A private spacecraft has landed on the Moon, becoming only the second commercial vehicle to reach the lunar surface. Blue Ghost left Earth on 15 January, after being launched by US firm Firefly Aerospace with the intention of exploring the Sea of Crises, a huge basin visible from Earth. The project is the latest collaboration by US space agency Nasa and private companies. Intuitive Machines, another firm, is hoping to land its Athena spacecraft near the Moon's south pole in the next few days. Intuitive was the first private company to achieve a lunar landing. Its spacecraft Odysseus reached the Moon on 22 February last year. However, the mission was short-lived as the spacecraft landed on the slope of a crater, broke some landing gear and toppled over. Blue Ghost touched down smoothly, having been orbiting the Moon for the last two weeks. Staff at Firefly's headquarters in Texas broke out into cheering and applause when they were told their landing was successful. Dr Simeon Barber, a planetary science researcher from the Open University, said Blue Ghost was essentially the first successful private venture to the Moon, as the vehicle was intact and responsive. He told BBC Breakfast: ""[They've] demonstrated a technology for landing on the surface of the Moon, the kind that had been forgotten after the Apollo era when we had astronauts on the [lunar] surface."" The importance of the Moon to many private firms, said Dr Barber, was to use it as a launch pad for exploring the rest of space. ""By going to the Moon, we can learn how to run robotic instruments in space [and] in the really harsh environment of the Moon, which is at times hot and at times cold. It's very dusty, there's lots of radiation."" He said at some point it was likely humans would return to the lunar surface and explained it had been so long because of a lack of funding. The last time humans set foot on the Moon was 19 December 1972, during the Apollo 17 mission. ""The Apollo missions were hugely successful,"" explained Dr Barber. ""But they were 'touch and go' missions."" Back then, astronauts would be there for three days before having to leave again, as costs were running into the billions of dollars. ""That's not sustainable,"" he said. Dr Barber said the belief now was that bringing private companies into the fold would help reduce costs as a result of commercial competition. It could lead to cheaper landers and innovations that might extract resources from the moon, such as water for the astronauts to drink. The first private company to attempt to reach the moon was another US firm, Astrobotic Technology. They tried reaching the moon in January 2024, but their lander never made it to the moon, because of a suspected fuel leak, and crashed back to Earth. The fiery descent meant the spacecraft broke apart in its final moments before plunging into the southern Pacific Ocean.",2025-03-02T10:43:47.369Z,George Sandeman
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36w7e4kglzo,"Pilates, painting and bike rides: Gene Hackman's life in Santa Fe","Gene Hackman was a normal person in Santa Fe. And he really loved that. Residents in the New Mexico city say they were excited to welcome such a massive celebrity to the community when he and his wife Betsy Arakawa arrived more than 20 years ago, but they treated him like anyone else. ""He wasn't famous here"" was the phrase I heard when asking residents about why the movie star chose to call New Mexico's capital home. They describe a down-to-earth, chatty man who supported local businesses and enjoyed its flourishing arts scene. Everyone here has a story to tell about Hackman, who was found dead alongside his wife and their dog at their home in the quiet desert city earlier this week. Hackman was a lover of the arts and a painter himself, so he fit in well: Santa Fe is known for its iconic adobe architecture and is home to more than 250 galleries. Everything in Santa Fe is colourful, from the woven tapestry hanging on shop walls to the clothes people wear and even their personalities. There are murals in almost every alley and metal street art lining the roads. Hackman immediately got involved with local art museums, most notably sitting on the board of directors at the Georgia O'Keeffe museum, while Arakawa had a luxury home-goods store, and collaborated with artists on various projects. Hackman's paintings are displayed prominently at local restaurants, and there are a few lucky residents who have them hanging in their home. One of those people is Stuart Ashman, the executive director of the Artes de Cuba gallery. Mr Ashman first met Hackman at a community arts meeting. He was running late and there was one seat left when he arrived: next to the Hollywood star. They shook hands and that started two decades of friendship. ""He was so down to earth that you didn't realize that you were talking to a celebrity. He was more interested in you than in telling you about himself,"" Mr Ashman said. While both men supported the arts community, their real bond came through Pilates workouts when they took back-to-back private lessons. When asked who was better, Mr Ashman laughed. ""I think we're both pretty bad,"" he said. ""Our teacher said I was lazy and he was older and stiffer."" Mr Ashman said Hackman often got in trouble for being too much of a chatterbox. ""Gene, are you going to workout or do you just want to talk to Stuart today?"" Mr Ashman recalls their Pilates teacher asking. Every week, Mr Ashman, who raised chickens, would bring a dozen eggs to Hackman. Then one day, he showed up with a huge landscape painting as repayment to Mr Ashman, who didn't want to accept it. But Hackman insisted and said a painting for eggs is ""a very fair deal"". When Hackman wasn't at Pilates or riding his bike through the beautiful landscape, he loved to spend time at his home in the hills above the city, his friends said. Perched on a 12-acre plot, the property has panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, with vistas stretching as far as Colorado. Hackman purchased the home in the 1980s before starting expansive renovations. He wanted this home to have meaning, so he worked with an architect to blend Pueblo, Colonial, and Spanish Baroque architectural styles to pay homage to Santa Fe's rich cultural history. Arakawa also enjoyed her secluded life in Santa Fe. People I spoke to said she was a talented pianist and smart business woman. The only person who liked working out more than Hackman was Betsy. They said she was in incredible shape, always attending exercise classes. Though Hackman was an active member of the community for most of his post-Hollywood years, he became much more isolated after Covid-19 lockdowns, locals said. Those who knew him speculate his health and age made mobility too difficult to wander down the hill into town. But everyone still had a story about Hackman. James Roybal, a native of Santa Fe, once signed up for a pastel painting class in the 1980s and when he arrived Hackman was also there. They painted next to each other for a bit, making small talk. Mr Roybal couldn't believe the celebrity would want to be there. He took a picture from a ways back because he didn't think anyone would believe him. He still boasts about the image. Victoria Murphy, a real estate agent and actress, saw him around town on several occasions. ""I was in the middle of the street as I was crossing in the crosswalk, and he started to go through the stop sign at that time, and then suddenly saw me stopped, waved, smiled, held up both hands, you know, like in a surrender,"" she recalled. ""And I just smiled and kept going."" At a local restaurant in town, customers told me they'd see him at the grocery store, or shopping on the high street. David, the general manager of a shop in downtown Santa Fe where Hackman was a long-time patron, was holding back tears, remembering his friend and client. ""Since he lived here, he wanted to use his money towards the local people. He always bought Seiko watches from my store for his friends and family. ""He invested in local restaurants and grocery stores, and showed up to openings for art museums. It obviously wasn't because he needed the money, but because he loved the local flare,"" he said. ""We lost a great Santa Fein.""",2025-03-01T11:16:44.140Z,Samantha Granville
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgeq3y1825o,RFK's measles response under scrutiny as deadly outbreak frightens Texas parents,"In her hometown of Lubbock, Texas, Leah, a pregnant mother, has been avoiding stores and other public spaces for the last two weeks. On Wednesday, the city saw a six-year-old child who was not vaccinated against the virus die – the first US death from the measles in nearly a decade. With a baby on the way, Leah could be putting her foetus at risk of health complications if she contracted the virus, despite her own vaccination. Her paediatrician also advised her to move up her older son's second shot of the vaccine - the full course for the immunisation - as the risk to his health grows. ""Mentally, it's taking a toll on me, thinking about not just myself and my child, but also about the people that I have to be around,"" said Leah, who declined to share her last name for privacy reasons. The US declared measles ""eliminated"" from the country in 2000, but in recent years, as anti-vaccine sentiments rose, the country has seen several outbreaks of the virus. The Texas outbreak began in a small Mennonite community near Lubbock, home to 260,000, and has since spread. To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said. On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak ""not unusual"", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents. Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states. ""We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions,"" Leah said. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC. Since the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off. She has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus. ""It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic,"" she told the BBC. Ms Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death. People who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles. That includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting. His wife is nine months pregnant and plans to deliver in the same hospital where the patient died of the measles. Mr Rable is terrified for his son's first year of life. ""With it spreading essentially like wildfire out here, do we just not leave our house for a year? We can't do that,"" he said. To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin. But several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated. ""When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community,"" said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine. Now, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine. ""I share that concern with them,"" said Dr Malbari. Before Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine sceptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now. He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to ""do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult"" to get vaccines. But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses. He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover. Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of ""informed consent"" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News reported last week. The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official. But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is ""what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination"". On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed. In addition to calling the Texas outbreak ""not unusual"", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses. Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades. ""It's a devastating disease,"" he said. ""And it's completely preventable."" For some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch. Leah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds. ""If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs,"" she said. But Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days. Still, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure. ""In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice,"" she said. Local health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said. ""We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more,"" he said. ""It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine.""",2025-03-01T08:33:30.051Z,Madeline Halpert
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx7kez4vx2o,Cuts to national parks and forests met with backlash,"The Trump administration's steep cuts to staff at national parks, forests and wildlife habitats have triggered a growing backlash, as public access and conservation efforts in these remote wild landscapes fade away. The impacts have already been felt by visitors - who are seeing longer park entrance lines, reduced hours at visitor centres, trails closed and dirty public facilities - and workers who not only are worried about their futures as their jobs vanish, but also the state of these outdoor marvels eroding. Each season, Kate White and her team typically carry 600lbs (270kg) of litter on their backs out of the Enchantments, a sensitive alpine wilderness located in Washington state that welcomes over 100,000 visitors a year. Remote and often covered in snow and ice, staff are needed to maintain backcountry toilets that must be serviced with helicopters, which Ms White says may overflow without proper maintenance. ""I'm not totally sure what the plan is to get that done,"" she says. ""That's probably gonna be very damaging to the ecosystem in that area, and maybe to the visitor experience."" But one of the most important parts of her job was to keep people safe - and be there if the worst happened. As a National Forest wilderness ranger for over nine years, she has seen her share of tragedy when hikers or campers are confronted with severe weather and remote and tricky terrain. She has comforted people who have faced life-threatening injuries and even recovered bodies of hikers who died while out in the steep and often icy mountain region. ""We were kind of usually first on scene if something were to happen,"" she says. On any typical Saturday in the summer months, she'd speak to an average of 1,000 visitors. She and her team published reports on trail conditions and helped hikers who appeared unprepared - wearing sandals or not carrying enough water - and guided them to easier and safer routes. Now, those jobs are gone. She worries what the cuts will mean for the future of public safety and how people experience US parks and forests, especially ahead of the busy spring and summer months when millions travel to visit. Mass terminations, first announced on 14 February, have led to 5% of the National Park Service staff – around 1,000 workers - being forced out. The cuts have hit the US Forest Service, which maintains thousands of miles of popular hiking trails, even harder. Around 10% of the Forest Service's staff - about 3,400 people, including Ms White and her team - have been fired. The cuts have upended the management of national parks, which get around 325 million visitors annually, as well as national forests, which see about 159 million visitors each year. Long queues of cars were stuck outside Grand Canyon National Park over President's Day weekend, one day after the mass firing, due to a lack of toll operators to check people in at the gate. Similar lines of cars have been growing at other parks as well. A popular trail outside Seattle was closed indefinitely only hours after the cuts were announced, with a sign at the trailhead explaining that the closure is ""due to the large scale termination of Forest Service employees"" and ""will reopen when we return to appropriate staffing levels"". At Yosemite National Park, the annual ""firefall"" spectacle led to a different kind of display this year when a group, which reportedly included employees, hung an upside-down American flag at the park in protest of the Trump administration's recent deep cuts to staff. Andria Townsend, a carnivore biologist who supervised a team of eight people at Yosemite National Park before she was fired in an email, told the BBC she ""100%"" supports the protest. ""It's bringing lots of good attention to the issue,"" she says. She says she is especially worried for the future of the endangered species that she had been working to protect. Ms Townsend studied and attached GPS collars to the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Pacific fisher, which is related to a badger, in attempts to track and preserve the species. ""They both are in dire straits,"" she says, with only about 50 fishers and 500 red fox left in the wild. Staff at a sister site conducting similar research were also cut. ""I don't want to be doom and gloom, but it's really hard to say what the future is now,"" she says. ""The future of conservation just feels very uncertain."" Long-time couple Claire Thompson, 35, and Xander Demetrios, 36, have worked for the Forest Service for about a decade, most recently maintaining trails in central Washington state so that hikers could explore the snow-capped Cascade mountains. The email firing them and thousands of other staff cited ""performance"" issues – something they took issue with. ""Especially with the amount we've gone above and beyond,"" says Mr Demetrios, explaining that his work in the backcountry had carried significant risk to his safety, and sometimes involved rescuing people from dangerous situations, including one person who had fallen in a river and become hypothermic. He and Ms Thompson have carried heavy equipment through rugged terrain, through foul weather at times, to clear trails and repair bridges and outhouses – and never being paid more than $22 (£17.40) an hour. ""It's been hurtful - insulting - to just feel like your work is so devalued, and by people who I'm quite certain have like zero concept of what we do at all,"" Ms Thompson added. Following a backlash, dozens of national park staff were reportedly rehired since the mass terminations on Valentine's Day. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, whose department oversees the National Park Service (NPS), has also committed to hiring over 5,000 seasonal workers during the coming warm months. ""On a personal level, of course, I've got great empathy for anybody that loses a job,"" Burgum told Fox News last Friday. ""But I think we have to realise that every American is better off if we actually stop having a $2 trillion a year deficit."" The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) being spearheaded by Elon Musk claims to have saved over $65bn from the widespread cuts which have hit dozens of federal agencies across government. However, it has produced no evidence to back that figure, which would represent around 0.9% of the entire 2024 federal budget. Outdoor advocates say that travellers currently planning their outdoor vacations to national parks should expect numerous issues, including increased litter, a shortage of lodging and the unavailability of many services they have come to expect. ""If the administration doesn't reverse these policies, visitors are going to need to lower their expectations,"" says John Garder of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in Washington DC. Some of these cuts are already being felt: Yosemite has fired their only locksmith, Gettysburg fired the staff who handle cabin reservations for visitors, and hurricane damage to the Appalachian Trail won't get repaired in time for through-hikers trying to complete the 2,200-mile (3,540km) trail. Meanwhile, private businesses that operate in and around parks stand to lose out on billions of dollars if visitors drop off, according to the NPCA. Concerns are also growing about the absence of park and forest service personnel who assist in wildfire fighting during the dry season. Wildland firefighters, like Dan Hilden, have so far been exempted from forest service cuts. He says the roles of the people who were terminated are ""completely crucial"" to fire safety. Many directly fight fires, while others are responsible for ""sweeping"" backcountry trails - telling people to leave and ensuring that no one is in danger from expanding fires. ""I don't know how we'll be doing that this summer, because we're heavily dependent on them,"" says Hilden, explaining that it takes several days to travel into the wilderness for these sweeps. ""Every year things have been getting worse as the staffing issues go. This year is going to be a lot worse.""",2025-03-01T05:14:00.310Z,Max Matza
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dejydynngo,Trump accuses Zelensky of 'gambling with World War Three',"Donald Trump has clashed with Volodymyr Zelensky in a furious exchange at the White House, with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia ""or we are out"". The pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal. After relations first became strained over Trump's handling of Ukraine peace talks with Russia, the minerals agreement was supposed to be a stepping stone towards further security ties between the countries. But Zelensky was told by the Americans to leave before the deal could be signed. At one point, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support, and that he was ""gambling with World War Three"". Zelensky had earlier argued there should be ""no compromises"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin - but Trump said Kyiv would have to make concessions to reach a peace deal with Russia. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory. The meeting to discuss the US-Ukraine deal, which involved access to Ukrainian oil, gas and rare minerals, came after the new US president appeared to blame Zelensky for the war and chided him for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier. His tone had softened in recent days, with Trump saying he had ""a lot of respect"" for the Ukrainian leader. But Friday's conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sat alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky responded by asking ""what kind of diplomacy?"", referencing a previous ceasefire deal in 2019, agreed three years before Russia's full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraine's east. The vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and ""litigating"" the situation in front of the media. From there, the discussion escalated quickly, as Trump and Vance accused Ukraine's president of being ungrateful for three years of US support during the war with Russia, with Trump saying Zelensky was in no position to tell the US how it should feel. Not long after the meeting - and well ahead of the pre-planned schedule - Zelensky was seen leaving the White House in his official vehicle. Trump took to Truth Social, the social media platform he owns, to say ""Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office"". ""I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,"" the Republican president continued. ""I don't want advantage, I want PEACE."" Zelensky also posted on social media, thanking the president and the US four times. In a later interview with Fox News, Zelensky said the public spat ""was not good"" - but the relationship between him and Trump could be salvaged. ""Because the relations are more than just two presidents,"" he said, adding that it was also about ""strong relations between our two people."" Reaction to the White House meeting among US politicians appeared to fall along partisan lines, with Republicans praising Trump and Democrats criticising him. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham - once a staunch supporter of Ukraine - told reporters: ""What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again."" He said Zelensky ""either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries described Zelensky's treatment as ""appalling"", adding that it ""will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin"". In Ukraine, there was broadly appreciation for Zelensky holding his ground over what is, for them, an existential war. ""Trump's administration was so arrogant,"" one man in Kyiv told the BBC. ""When you look at Zelensky's face, you understand that the discussion behind the closed doors was not so polite. ""They are so rude, they don't respect the people of Ukraine. They even don't hide it."" The Oval Office spat also prompted words of support for Zelensky from key European allies, including France. A spokeswoman for UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - who has cast himself as a mediator between the US and Europe as the Trump administration adopts a more isolationist approach to the continent - said he had spoken to both leaders. She said Sir Keir ""retains unwavering support for Ukraine, and is doing all he can to find a path forward to a lasting peace"". Friedrich Merz, who is expected to become Germany's next chancellor, wrote that he stood with Ukraine ""in good and testing times"", adding: ""We must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war."" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that ""today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge"". Russia, meanwhile, said Trump and Vance had acted with restraint. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said it was a miracle the pair hadn't hit Zelensky.",2025-03-01T00:39:57.383Z,Tom McArthur & Jaroslav Lukiv
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyveq30lmdlo,Illinois man convicted for hate crime murder of Palestinian boy,"An Illinois landlord has been found guilty of murder and hate crime charges for fatally stabbing a Palestinian-American child in 2023 and severely wounding his mother. Prosecutors said Joseph Czuba, 73, targeted the family over their Muslim faith following the Israel-Hamas war. Police found six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume and his mother, Hanan Shaheen, with severe stab wounds inside a house she rented from Czuba in a Chicago suburb on 14 October, 2023. The boy later died in the hospital. Czuba had pleaded not guilty, but jurors convicted him after deliberating for less than 90 minutes. Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting After the verdict, the boy's father, Odai,told reporters in Arabic: ""I don't know if I should be pleased or upset, if I should be crying or laughing."" ""I feel like this decision came a little too late,"" he said. Jurors heard testimony from a number of witnesses, including Al-Fayoume's mother. Ms Shaheen testified that she rented rooms from Czuba in suburban Chicago, and had no problems with him at first. But tensions escalated after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, 2023, with Czuba expressing anti-Muslim views and asking her to move out of the home, where he also lived. A few days after that conversation, Czuba forced his way into her room and stabbed her with a knife more than a dozen times, Ms Shaheen testified. ""He told me 'You, as a Muslim, must die,'"" she said. After she retreated to call for help, Ms Shaheen said Czuba attacked her son. Prosecutors said the child had been stabbed 26 times. He died from the injuries shortly after the attack. Police testified that they found Czuba outside the house after the attack, with blood on his body and hands. Lawyers for Czuba defended him by arguing that pieces of evidence linking him to the crimes were missing. His ex-wife testified in the trial, and said he rarely had violent outbursts in their 30-year marriage. But jurors found him guilty of the crimes after a short deliberation. Czuba faces life in prison without parole. Sentencing is scheduled for May. The young boy had celebrated his sixth birthday just a few weeks before he was killed. ""He loved his family, his friends. He loved soccer, he loved basketball,"" the executive director of the Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Ahmed Rehab, said at the time.",2025-02-28T22:42:18.176Z,Nadine Yousif
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2je1djrm2o,Government vows to clean up England's largest lake,"Environment Secretary Steve Reed has pledged to work towards ensuring that ""only rainwater"" enters England's largest lake. Speaking on a visit to Windermere, Reed said the government would work with the water company, local authorities in Cumbria and environmental groups to draft a feasibility study to eliminate all discharges into the lake. Currently, treated wastewater and untreated sewage is at times discharged into the lake and scientists say it has contributed to algal blooming where the water turns green. United Utilities, the water company that serves Windermere, said it was committed to improving its water quality and was spending £200m on wastewater treatment. In 2024, it was revealed the firm had repeatedly discharged millions of litres of raw sewage illegally into the lake over a three-year period. Reed told BBC Breakfast it was ""wholly unacceptable that this lake was allowed to be contaminated with so much pollution - more than 140 million litres."" Reed did not offer details as to how all discharges into Windermere would be stopped, but it would almost certainly require a large network of new sewage pipes to take the wastewater and sewage away. Last year, United Utilities published a feasibility study that concluded it would require 42 miles (67km) of new pipes to take the discharges downstream and 205 miles (330km) of new network to connect private sewage facilities. The study was not costed but it is likely to be in the hundreds of millions of pounds. Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year. Matt Staniek, a campaigner against sewage pollution and founder of Save Windermere, has been invited to be part of the feasibility study. He said the announcement felt ""like a new dawn"" for Windermere but remained cautious, adding: ""This is so far just an objective, it's a vision, it's an ambition and we want to see this absolutely concrete. ""We want to see a legally binding commitment and we're going to continue [to campaign] until that happens."" Asked when the water in Windermere might be safe enough to swim in, Reed told BBC Breakfast: ""It won't be ready as quickly as summer. It's taken a long time to get to the state that it's in."" However, Nigel Wilkinson, managing director of Windermere Lake Cruises, said the minister's comment was ""simply not true"" and Windermere was safe to bathe in. Official data on the quality of bathing water rated Windermere excellent at the last survey in September. Mr Wilkinson said: ""It's simply not true and it's absolutely disastrous for our visitor economy, we have the Windermere Great Swim coming up in June, with up to 10,000 people swimming in the lake. ""This misinformation is absolutely appalling."" As a first step, the government said it was looking at new ways to reduce pollution from private sewage discharges into Windermere. These included new treatment plants, along with schemes which would let owners of septic tanks and package treatment works ask for a connection to the mains sewer under certain conditions. As part of the scheme, United Utilities is spending £200m to upgrade nine wastewater treatment works at Windermere and said it would reduce spills from six storm overflows discharging into the lake by 2030. Though that money will initially come from investors, it will ultimately be paid for through increased customer bills. Over the next five years, United Utilities customers will on average see their bills rise by 32% above the rate of inflation. It is not clear how long it will take for the Windermere feasibility study to be completed. But, if and when the plans are approved, it could raise bills further. Reed said: ""The government is committed to cleaning up this iconic lake. ""That is why we are working with a range of local groups and organisations to stop all sewage going into the lake and restore it to its natural beauty."" A United Utilities spokesperson said they had already invested £75m to cut pollution in the lake. They added: ""Today's announcement by the government looks at a long-term plan for only rainfall entering Windermere and we will be working with the other partners involved to support this.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20l5dn39w2o,Russia expels two more British diplomats,"A British diplomat and the spouse of another diplomat are being expelled from Russia, the country's domestic security service has said, in what is being seen as the latest tit-for-tat escalation. The two men are accused of ""intelligence and subversive work"" by the Federal Security Service (FSB) which said they had been stripped of their accreditation and ordered to leave Russia within two weeks. The UK Foreign Office said: ""This is not the first time that Russia has made malicious and baseless accusations against our staff."" Last month, the UK expelled a Russian diplomat - an action taken in response to Moscow's expulsion of a British diplomat in November 2024. The Russian Foreign Ministry had said then that it intended to retaliate to the expulsion. In the past year alone, there have been seven British diplomats expelled from Russia with Moscow accusing them of espionage - allegations denied by the UK. Relations between the UK and Russia have deteriorated to post-Cold War lows in the years following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Monday's reported action, Moscow said it was expelling the diplomats on grounds of espionage. In a statement the FSB said the two had declared ""false information about themselves when receiving permission"" to enter Russia. Russia's foreign ministry said on Monday it had also summoned a representative of the British embassy ""in protest"".  The pair appear to be the first western diplomatic expulsions by Moscow since Russia and the US held talks on restoring relations last month - the first time in three years since the start of the Ukraine war. But relations between Britain and Russia have been further strained as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has resolutely stood by Ukraine. He has pledged to increase defence spending and called on countries to join a ""coalition of the willing"" to deter Russia from further invading Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. He has committed the UK to putting boots on the ground and planes in the air to help maintain a peace. Moscow has criticised the idea of a foreign peacekeeping mission.",2025-03-10T09:59:39.649Z,Vicky Wong

""I am truly overwhelmed. Miuccia performed her best"". It is the first time a dog from Italy has won best in show, which comes with a trophy and small cash prize of reportedly £200. Miuccia, who is owned by Enrico De Gaspari, was the winner of the hound group earlier in the show, and beat the winners of six other groups to win the top prize. ""I absolutely adore her,"" said handler Mr Liguori. ""She is the sweetest dog. ""She always wants to be super close to me and that's the most important thing."" Mr Liguori said it was ""incredible, it's amazing"" to be the first dog from Italy to be crowned best in show. ""As Italians we are super proud and means that we are doing a fantastic job."" Helen Kerfoot, Crufts show manager, said it was ""fantastic"" to watch Miuccia and her handler's ""strong relationship together in the ring, and they are truly deserving winners"". ""Well done to all of our other wonderful finalists too.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ern1zjkvyo,Lab-grown food could be sold in UK within two years,"Meat, dairy and sugar grown in a lab could be on sale in the UK for human consumption for the first time within two years, sooner than expected. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is looking at how it can speed up the approval process for lab-grown foods. Such products are grown from cells in small chemical plants. UK firms have led the way in the field scientifically but feel they have been held back by the current regulations. Dog food made from meat that was grown in factory vats went on sale in the UK for the first time last month. In 2020, Singapore became the first country to authorise the sale of cell-cultivated meat for human consumption, followed by the United States three years later and Israel last year. However, Italy and the US states of Alabama and Florida have instituted bans. The FSA is to develop new regulations by working with experts from high-tech food firms and academic researchers. It says it aims to complete the full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the two-year process it is starting. But critics say that having the firms involved in drawing up the new rules represents a conflict of interest. The initiative is in response to concerns by UK firms that they are losing ground to competition overseas, where approvals processes take half the time. Prof Robin May, the FSA's chief scientist, told BBC News that there would be no compromise on consumer safety. ""We are working very closely with the companies involved and academic groups to work together to design a regulatory structure that is good for them, but at all costs ensures the safety of these products remains as high as it possibly can,"" he said. But critics such as Pat Thomas, director of the campaign group Beyond GM, are not convinced by this approach. ""The companies involved in helping the FSA to draw up these regulations are the ones most likely to benefit from deregulation and if this were any other type of food product, we would be outraged by it,"" she said. The science minister, Lord Vallance, took issue with the process being described as ""deregulation"". ""It is not deregulation, it is pro-innovation regulation,"" he told BBC News. ""It is an important distinction, because we are trying to get the regulation aligned with the needs of innovation and reduce some of the bureaucracy and duplication."" Lab-grown foods are grown into plant or animal tissue from tiny cells. This can sometimes involve gene editing to tweak the food's properties. The claimed benefits are that they are better for the environment and potentially healthier. The government is keen for lab-grown food firms to thrive because it hopes they can create new jobs and economic growth. The UK is good at the science, but the current approvals process is much slower than in other countries. Singapore, the US and Israel in particular have faster procedures. Ivy Farm Technologies in Oxford is ready to go with lab-grown steaks, made from cells taken from Wagyu and Aberdeen Angus cows. The firm applied for approval to sell its steaks to restaurants at the beginning of last year. Ivy Farm's CEO, Dr Harsh Amin, explained that two years was a very long time to wait. ""If we can shorten that to less than a year, while maintaining the very highest of Britain's food safety standards, that would help start-up companies like ours to thrive."" Dr Alicia Graham has a similar story. Working at Imperial College, London's Bezos centre in west London, she has found a way to grow an alternative to sugar. It involves introducing a gene found in a berry into yeast. This process enables her to produce large amounts of the crystals that make it taste sweet. It doesn't make you fat, she says, and so is a potential sweetener and healthy substitute in fizzy drinks. In this case I am allowed to taste it. It was incredibly sweet and slightly sour and fruity, reminding me of lemon sherbet. But Dr Graham's firm, MadeSweetly, is not allowed to sell it until it gets approval. ""The path to getting approval is not straightforward,"" she tells me. ""They are all new technologies, which are not easy for the regulator to keep up with. But that means that we don't have one specific route to product approval, and that is what we would like."" The FSA says it will complete a full safety assessment of two lab-grown foods within the next two years and have the beginnings of a faster and better system for applications for approvals of new lab-grown foods. Prof May of the FSA says the purpose of working with experts from the companies involved as well as academics is to get the science right. ""It can be quite complex, and it is critical that we understand the science to make sure the foods are safe before authorising them."" But Ms Thomas says that these high-tech foods may not be as environmentally friendly as they are made out to be as it takes energy to make them and that in some cases their health benefits are being oversold. ""Lab-grown foods are ultimately ultra-processed foods and we are in an era where we are trying to get people to eat fewer ultra-processed foods because they have health implications,"" he said. ""And it is worth saying that these ultra-processed foods have not been in the human diet before.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mwxxn71w0o,Man charged after climbing Big Ben's Elizabeth Tower,"A man has been charged by police after scaling Big Ben's Elizabeth Tower at the Palace of Westminster in central London on Saturday. Daniel Day, 29, of Palmerston Road, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, has been charged with causing a public nuisance and trespassing on a protected site after climbing onto the clock tower, the Metropolitan Police said. He has been remanded in custody to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. Emergency services were called at 07:24 GMT on Saturday to reports of a protester who had climbed up the tower holding a Palestinian flag. The barefoot man was brought down in a cherry picker as Big Ben struck midnight, after more than 16 hours on a ledge several metres up the tower. On Sunday, Westminster Police said a man had been arrested once he reached the ground after what it called a ""protracted incident"". The incident led to the closure of Westminster Bridge, one of the exits at Westminster Underground Station, and Bridge Street. Tours of the Parliamentary Estate were also cancelled in response. A small group of supporters gathered behind a police cordon below the tower shouting ""free Palestine"" and ""you are a hero"".",2025-03-10T00:39:52.773Z,Ian Aikman
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17q9lrl57ro,Couple who found migrant in motorhome are fined,"A couple who discovered a migrant had clung to the back of their vehicle all the way home from France have been issued a £1,500 fine. Adrian and Joanne Fenton said they called police when they found the person zipped inside the cover of a bike rack at their home in Heybridge, Essex, in October. They later received a fine from the Home Office for failing to ""check that no clandestine entrant was concealed"" in the motorhome. The pair said they were drafting an appeal. The Home Office said penalties were ""designed to target negligence rather than criminality"". ""At no point did I believe I would be fined by taking correct and moral action,"" said Mr Fenton, writing in an email exchange to the Home Office, seen by the BBC. ""This action taken by Border Force to impose a fine only encourages travellers [or] holidaymakers in this position not to call the police but to let the stowaway abscond."" Speaking to the JVS Show on BBC Three Counties Radio, Mrs Fenton said the pair had been travelling in France with friends and returned to the UK via ferry on 15 October. The 55-year-old said border officials in Calais and the UK had not inspected the bike rack or the cover before or after the crossing. Retired firefighter Mr Fenton, 57, had been at the wheel for the six-hour journey before the pair arrived home at 22:15 BST. Mrs Fenton said her husband unzipped the ""really tight"" cover they had been using for their bicycles on the back of the motorhome. ""He sees two trainers... goes to have a look, and there's two legs attached to it,"" she recalled. ""He's gone 'Jo, you need to phone the police. We've got a stowaway.'"" Mrs Fenton said she offered the young man a bottle of water, to which he said ""thank you"". She said he told police he was from Sudan, and that he was 16 years old. The Essex couple were travelling in Australia over Christmas when they received an email from the Home Office with details of the offence and fine. It said they failed to ""check that no clandestine entrant was concealed in the vehicle"", but Mrs Fenton contested that technically he was clinging to the outside rather than aboard the motorhome. The email also said the ""entrant"" was found by an authorised search officer, despite the couple saying they called the police the night they found him. The fine referenced asylum and immigration legislation.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7430zw4zqyo,Lawyer probing Reform UK row contradicts MP Lowe,"A senior lawyer who was appointed by Reform UK to independently investigate allegations against MP Rupert Lowe and his team has denied she told the MP she was ""shocked"" about the process. The Great Yarmouth MP was suspended by Reform and referred to the police over accusations he made threats of violence against the party's chairman. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed they are assessing an allegation of ""verbal threats"". There have also been allegations of bullying in Lowe's offices, which are being investigated by the lawyer hired by the party. Lowe strongly denies all the claims, saying ""there is no credible evidence against me"", and says he is the victim of ""a political assassination because I dared to question Nigel Farage"". Last week, Lowe said he had spoken to the senior lawyer looking at the claims and said she had told him she was ""shocked"" at the process, and that no evidence had been given. On Sunday, the lawyer, a KC who has not been named by the party but whose credentials have been verified by the BBC, said: ""I have seen a number of statements made by Mr Lowe MP which are attributed to me and which describe my reactions to the process conducted by the party into the allegations made against both Mr Lowe MP and his constituency manager. ""I find myself in the unfortunate and regrettable position of having to make this statement to correct the record."" The lawyer added: ""I have not expressed either 'dismay' or 'shock' at any time as to the process. Nor have I said 'there is zero credible evidence against [Mr Lowe]', let alone said this 'repeatedly'."" On Friday, Lowe took issue with a statement issued by Reform, which set out that there would be an independent investigation into what had happened. He wrote: ""I have just spoken to the KC. She is dismayed that this statement has been made, and reiterated that no evidence against me has been sent to her. ""She stated that this has been issued before the investigation has even started. ""She is shocked at the process, shocked at the communication from the party, and shocked that no credible evidence has been given, despite her repeated requests."" The BBC put the lawyer's statement to Lowe, who then issued his own statement in reply. ""Ever since this malicious attack on my reputation was launched, all I have asked for from both Reform and the KC is credible evidence against me. None has been provided. It still hasn't,"" he said. ""The KC has said she has been 'chasing' for that. I have received nothing. Because there is no credible evidence against me."" He added: ""I have spoken with the KC at length, on the phone and through message. I've got to know her over the last week, and she has been very helpful, and is a charming lady who is trying to do her job in the very difficult position that Reform has put her in."" He accused the party of an ""outright lie"" in claiming he had not co-operated with the investigation, a claim Reform made in a statement on Friday evening. ""I have been in discussions with my legal team this afternoon, and this will be followed by legal action in due course,"" Lowe told the BBC. ""I will not have my name dragged through the mud as part of a political assassination because I dared to question Nigel Farage. You have to stand up to bullies, and I am doing exactly that."" He said the lawyer had told him on Friday night: ""I advised that you should simply say that the party was precipitous to state that these allegations had been made without also saying that the party has commissioned an independent investigation and the investigation has not yet got underway to look at all the evidence and evaluate its veracity."" Lowe's suspension came after the Daily Mail published an interview with Lowe where he said Reform under Nigel Farage's leadership remained a ""protest party led by the Messiah"". Reform has removed the whip from Lowe, meaning he now sits as an independent MP. Reform spokeswoman Ann Widdecombe said the row was ""temporarily damaging"" to the party - but ""not damaging in the long term"". Widdecombe told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""The fact is all parties have these eruptions from time to time. ""But while the investigations are under way I think we should simply wait until they report, and then we will know where we are.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge76gd3e1o,King to launch Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Baton Relay,"King Charles will launch the King's Baton Relay at Buckingham Palace later, ahead of the Glasgow 2026 Commonwealth Games. It is the 18th official Commonwealth Games relay and marks 500 days until the event begins on 23 July next year. He will hand the baton to champion cyclist Sir Chris Hoy - the first bearer on its journey around the world. The relay, which begins in London as a part of Commonwealth Day celebrations, will be the King's first as head of the Commonwealth. Following Sir Chris Hoy, the next three baton bearers will be wheelchair racer Sammi Kinghorn, ocean plastics campaigner Keiran Healy and Trinidad & Tobago judo athlete Gabriella Wood - who studies at the University of Stirling. Trinidad & Tobago will be the first destination for the relay. The King will place a sealed message into the baton. It will remain inside until the opening ceremony when will be read out to mark the start of games. Meanwhile, First Minister John Swinney will be in London later to attend the annual Commonwealth Day service of celebration at Westminster Abbey. Swinney said the games were a ""huge opportunity for Scotland on the world stage"". He added: ""Glasgow already has a tremendous record for hosting, receiving international recognition for the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games. ""Glasgow 2026 will bring huge economic benefits to the city and support upgrades to sporting facilities - benefitting individuals, communities and clubs."" The event will take place in Glasgow from 23rd July to 2nd August next year. It will feature a 10-sport programme with athletes from 74 nations and territories. Glasgow was announced as the host of the 2026 Games after the Australian state of Victoria - which had been due to host - withdrew over rising costs. The deal was secured after the Scottish government agreed to back it and the Victoria state administration promised a £2.3m investment. Scottish government minister Neil Gray said at the time the fact that the city was asked to step in and host the games was a ""testament to Glasgow and Scotland's fantastic reputation for hosting international events"". Organisers have stated the Games will come at no cost to the Scottish public purse, with funding coming from compensation paid to the Commonwealth Games Federation after the Australians pulled out. The UK government will provide financial support in the event of any increased security threat but has said it will not completely underwrite the Games. The 10-sport Glasgow Games will be a scaled-back version of the last time the city played host in 2014. The overall number of sports has halved from 20 in Birmingham in 2022 to combat rising hosting costs and time demands. However, more than 200 gold medals will still be contested at venues within an eight-mile corridor of the city. Swimming, track cycling and Para sports will each boast more medallists than in any of the previous 22 iterations of the Games. And athletics will have two new events - the mixed 4x400m relay and the Commonwealth Mile, which replaces the 1500m. Para sports will be fully integrated across six of the 10 disciplines, with a Games record of 47 medal events in total. A total of 26 cycling golds will be fought for at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, with eight of those in Para-track cycling. That is double the amount on offer three years ago. And 56 will be on offer at Tollcross International Swimming Centre, with the men's 800m and women's 1500m freestyle races included for the first time.",2025-03-10T10:05:53.048Z,N/A
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c798l9gz4y1o,Loved ones remembered on fifth anniversary of start of Covid,"Former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen said that ""a shadow passed over us"" and recited a moving poem of Covid pandemic memories to mark the fifth anniversary since the outbreak of the deadly virus. Emotional scenes played out across the UK on Sunday as the bereaved and their communities hosted hundreds of events to mark the fifth anniversary of the start of the pandemic in a day of reflection. Rosen, 78, was rushed to hospital with Covid and put into an induced coma in intensive care in March 2020. Speaking at a memorial event in Staffordshire, the poet said ""thanks to the expertise and care I received, I came through, but I look back over my shoulder and think of those who didn't"". BBC News is inviting readers to share their memories of the Covid-19 pandemic by using the form below. The annual day is one of the recommendations set out by the UK Commission on Covid Commemoration. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: ""As we mark five years since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, I know for many there is deep grief and loss that may never be relieved."" In London, sobbing could be heard as bereaved relatives, led by a Highland piper, joined well wishers to walk beside the National Covid Memorial Wall. They passed 3,000 photographs of the faces of some of those who died, which represents just over 1% of the total death toll from Covid in the UK, organisers said. Choir song and a water cannon salute on the Thames from a London Fire Brigade fireboat brought the event to a close. A minute's silence was held after the chimes of Big Ben and long-stemmed red carnations were cast into the River Thames. Lynn Jones fought back tears as she remembered her ""fit and healthy"" 66-year-old husband Gareth who died after ""spending seven weeks in hospital battling the virus on his own"". She told those gathered at the London event that the Covid wall ""is an expression of so many emotions - rage, love, grief, pain and unbearable sadness"". Sisters Colette Woodall, Julie Harvey, and Jacquie McEvoy - who were originally from Liverpool - travelled from their homes in London and Wiltshire to pay their respects to their mother Joan Aspinall, who died in September 2021. ""So many people here are traumatised by what has happened,"" Ms Woodall said. ""Today has been absolutely poignant."" She added: ""It is important for us to be here to represent all of those faces on the wall and to be among like-minded people, some of whom are very angry and upset."" Well-wishers at the National Memorial Arboretum in Burton-on-Trent heard a new poem from the writer, poet, broadcaster and former Children's Laureate Michael Rosen, who spent time in hospital with Covid during the pandemic and was placed into an induced coma. ""A shadow passed over us and hundreds of thousands of people felt the sudden and unexpected loss of loved ones,"" he said. ""Thanks to the expertise and care I received, I came through, but I look back over my shoulder and think of those who didn't"" he said. Across the UK, just under 227,000 people died who had the virus listed as a cause of death - with more than 16,000 in Scotland and more than 12,300 people in Wales. Mary Kedward in Newport is a retired nurse who has reflected on her role helping out during the pandemic at Cambridge's Royal Papworth Hospital and later in the south-Wales city. Ms Kedward said she vaccinated people in the Welsh valleys and ""that was the best bit, talking to the housebound as they hadn't seen people for months"", adding that it was a ""privilege"". She adds that her mother died of Covid-19 in a care home and she ""did not have a proper funeral"", but instead had a remembrance on the video-calling platform Skype. Families who lost loved ones said on Thursday that they were angry there would be no nationwide anniversary events in Wales today, but the Welsh government has previously said events were being led by community groups. Maureen Oxley, who lives near Blackpool, said her and her husband separated in 2018 but at the end of February 2020, he invited her to stay with him during the first lockdown ""so that we could not face it alone"". She told the BBC that she would ""never forget"" the address Boris Johnson delivered to the nation and the Queen's address. ""We sat and held hands as we watched and wondered what the future held,"" Ms Oxley added. ""We shall never forget those days,"" she said. ""It was bittersweet but we are grateful we came out of the other end together."" In Scotland, a choir sang and a poem was read to take people into a minute's silence at the reflection event in Glasgow Green. Doves were released and the event also included a wreath being laid, a plaque unveiling and individual yellow roses being left in memory of loved ones. Earlier, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney, who took part in the Glasgow ceremony, sent his ""deepest condolences"" to people who lost loved ones during the pandemic. Speaking before the service he added: ""Children stopped going to school, many shops and businesses were closed, and we were no longer able to spend time with friends and family as normal."" The ceremony was organised by Connie McCready, who is the co-founder of Covid-19 families Scotland. Her fiance, Jim Russell, died in May 2020 after spending 35 days in hospital and was one of many remembered at the event. ""This day of reflection is a time to remember that behind every statistic, there is a person,"" she said. ""For every family member and community affected, we reflect on their pain, their love and their enduring grief."" Other events include a special prayer service at Manchester Cathedral and a remembrance concert with music, poems and readings in Belfast.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxv7wylz7o,Software bug at firm left NHS data 'vulnerable to hackers',"The NHS is ""looking into"" allegations that patient data was left vulnerable to hacking due to a software flaw at a private medical services company. The flaw was found last November at Medefer, which handles 1,500 NHS patient referrals a month. The software engineer who discovered the flaw believes the problem had existed for at least six years. Medefer says there is no evidence the flaw had been in place that long and stressed that patient data has not been compromised. The flaw was fixed a few days after being discovered. In late February the company commissioned an external security agency to undertake a review of its data management systems. An NHS spokesperson said: ""We are looking into the concerns raised about Medefer and will take further action if appropriate."" Medefer's system allows patients to book virtual appointments with doctors, and gives those clinicians access to the appropriate patient data. However, the software bug, discovered in November, made Medefer's internal patient record system vulnerable to hackers, the engineer said. The software engineer, who does not want to be named, was shocked by what he uncovered. ""When I found it, I just thought 'no, it can't be'."" The problem was in bits of software called APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow different computer systems to talk to each other. The engineer says that at Medefer those APIs were not properly secured, and could potentially have been accessed by outsiders, who would have been able to see patient information. He said it was unlikely that patient information was taken from Medefer, but that without a full investigation, the company could not have known for sure. ""I've worked in organisations where, if something like this happened, the whole system would be taken down immediately,"" he said. On discovering the flaw the engineer told the company that an external cybersecurity expert should be brought in to investigate the problem, which he says the company did not do. Medefer says the external security agency has confirmed that it has found no evidence of any breach of data and that all the company's data systems were currently secure. It says the process of investigating and fixing the API flaw was ""extremely open"". Medefer said it had reported the issue to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) and the CQC (Care Quality Commission), ""in the interests of transparency"", and that the ICO had confirmed there is no further action to be taken as there is no evidence of a breach. The engineer, who had been contracted in October to test for flaws in the company's software, left the company in January. In a statement Dr Bahman Nedjat-Shokouhi, founder and CEO of Medefer, said: ""There is no evidence of any patient data breach from our systems."" He confirmed that the flaw had been discovered in November and a fix was developed in 48 hours. ""The external security agency has asserted that the allegation that this flaw could have provided access to large amounts of patients' data is categorically false."" The security agency will complete its review later this week. Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi added: ""We take our duties to patients and the NHS very seriously. We hold regular external security audits of our systems by independent external security agencies, undertaken on multiple occasions every year.""  Cybersecurity experts, who have looked at information supplied by the software engineer, have expressed their concern. ""There is the possibility that Medefer stored data derived from the NHS not as securely as one would hope it would be,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. ""The database might be encrypted and all the other precautions taken, but if there is a way of glitching the API authorisation, anyone who knows how could potentially gain access,"" he added. Another expert pointed out that as Medefer deals with highly-sensitive, medical data, the company should have brought in cybersecurity experts as soon as the problem was identified. ""Even if the company suspected that no data was stolen, when facing an issue that could have resulted in a data breach, especially with data of the nature in question, an investigation and confirmation from a suitably qualified cybersecurity expert would be advisable,"" says Scott Helme, a security researcher. Medefer was founded in 2013 by Dr Nedjat-Shokouhi, with a goal to improve outpatient care. Since then its technology has been used by NHS trusts across the country. In a statement the NHS spokesperson said those trusts are responsible for their contracts with the private sector. ""Individual NHS organisations must ensure they meet their legal responsibilities and national data security standards to protect patient data when appointing suppliers, and we offer them support and training nationally on how this should be done.""",2025-03-10T01:24:16.966Z,Ben Morris
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddymq71zq5o,UK hotter than Costa del Sol on warmest weekend of the year,"The UK's warmest days of the year arrived this weekend, with temperatures reaching almost 20C in parts of the country. Temperatures topped 19.7C in Crosby near Liverpool and 18.7C in Harwarden in north Wales, while Killowen in Northern Ireland saw 17.2C and Threave in western Scotland recorded 17.3C. The warm weather has seen some spots in the UK hotter than popular European holiday destinations, including Spain's Balearic islands and the Costa del Sol. But BBC Weather forecasts that temperatures will drop next week, with cold air expected to come from the north. On Saturday, temperatures topped 19.1C in Bridgefoot, England. Scotland recorded a high of 18.3C in Threave, while Northern Ireland hit 17C in Castlederg. Wales matched Thursday's recording of 18.2C with Saturday's temperature in Porthmadog. Holiday hotspots such as Marbella in Spain or Italy's Amalfi Coast - known for their sunny climates - recorded lower temperatures than in the warmest parts of the UK. According to the Met Office, Marbella on Spain's south coast had a high of 15C on Saturday, Ibiza had a high of 17C, and Sorrento on the Amalfi Coast reached 14C. Temperatures this weekend are around five to eight degrees above average - more typical of May than March, when temperatures are normally around 8C to 11C across the UK. The warmer-than-average weather is a result of a south-easterly wind bringing air from continental Europe. But the nicer weather is not expected to last, nor has the UK turned a corner toward summer. Spring can often bring big swings in temperature and can sometimes even bring 'all four seasons in a day'. From Monday, the weather will switch to a northerly wind bringing a return of colder arctic air. Initially temperatures will drop in Scotland, with highs of only 4C to 8C. Then from Tuesday and the rest of the week, the colder air oozes south to all parts, bringing temperatures around two or three degrees below average. There is also the possibility of a bit of snow over higher ground and wintry showers elsewhere. Thursday was previously the warmest day of the year so far in England, Wales and Scotland with 19C recorded in Santon Downham in Suffolk and 18.2C in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion. The Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh reached 16.8C which is the highest on record for it this early in the year. In the meantime, make the most of the warmth this weekend and check the forecast for your local area on the BBC Weather website and app. Additional reporting by Hafsa Khalil and Mallory Moench",2025-03-09T18:57:38.685Z,Hollie Cole
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1eg57wn7o,Scotland's 'forgotten golfer': From PoW to sporting icon,"When Scotsman Bobby Cruickshank was taken prisoner during World War One, he could little have imagined he would later find enduring fame in America as a golfing legend. Born in Grantown-on-Spey in 1894, he escaped the prisoner of war camp and eventually crossed the Atlantic to follow his golfing dream. He went on to win more than 20 tournaments and be considered a sporting great in the USA. But his story is far less well known back home in Scotland. Now the Highland course where he learned to play is offering golfers an ""immersive"" experience in his honour, including the chance to use hickory clubs of the style he played with in the 1920s and 1930s. Bobby was born about 400 yards - or roughly the length of a par-four hole - from Grantown-on-Spey golf course. At the time, it was just a nine-hole course. But it was big enough for Bobby. He caddied there as well as learning to play the game. Bobby later moved to Edinburgh where he developed his education and sporting skills, ultimately resulting in him pursuing his golfing ambitions. But World War One got in the way. Bobby signed up and managed to survive the horrors of the Somme only to be captured by the Germans. He succeeded in escaping a PoW camp at Arras in France. Bobby emigrated in 1921, joining a wave of Scottish golfers seeking success in the growing American golf scene. It was there that he ultimately won a series of tournaments and finished runner-up in the US Open in 1923 and 1932. He played alongside other greats of that era including Bobby Jones and his golfing status saw him rub shoulders with Hollywood icons including Charlie Chaplin. In 1967 he was elected to the PGA of America Hall of Fame - the highest honour it can bestow upon its membership or ambassadors of golf. Other greats of the game to have the same honour include Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. Bobby died at the age of 80 in 1975. Granddaughter Diana Smith, 82, who lives in Georgia, USA, is proud of his achievements. ""He was one of the finest people you could ever meet,"" she told BBC Scotland News. ""He loved the game dearly. He, along with his group of buddies in the States, literally started the concept of what is now the golf tour."" ""We had more laughs on the golf course than I can even tell you. He used to chase the alligators away with his club,"" she said. ""When he couldn't play golf anymore, he quickly passed away."" Diana and the rest of Bobby's family are delighted by the new project at his home course. ""We are thrilled. I know how much Grantown meant to my family and my grandad. I'm very proud of him. And I'm happy that people are recognising him. ""It's easy to forget, but he was so much part of the golf world and for this chance for people to get to know him, does my heart good."" Grantown-on-Spey Golf Club - which was established in 1890 - has launched the Bobby Cruickshank Hickory Experience. Players can use a set of hickory clubs and see footage, photographs and memorabilia related to Bobby's exploits. Club member Bill Mitchell, 90, remembers Bobby Cruickshank well. ""I remember him coming over on holiday and he had a huge American car,"" he said. ""I recall him coming down one night and his nephew was practising bunker shots. ""Bobby was all dressed up in his dinner jacket, ready to go out for a meal with some friends. ""And he saw his nephew and Bobby said 'Give me your wedge and one ball and I'll give you 10 shots if you can put it nearer to the hole'. ""And of course he just flopped it out, six inches away, and his nephew had no chance. ""He was a class act, there's no doubt about it."" He added: ""He had a super swing - a no-nonsense swing. One waggle and away it went."" Steve Stuart from Grantown-on-Spey Golf Club has been driving the legacy project. ""He won 25 tournaments in America - I can't think of another Scot who has done that,"" he said. Mr Stuart described Scottish golf tourism as ""amazing"" with the best courses in the world. ""Most of the tourists visit them, but you've also got lots of hidden gems and we like to think that we're one of those,"" he said. ""So what we're trying to do is celebrate our unique selling point in Bobby Cruickshank. ""Tourists can expect a true and immersive history lesson. And if they have never played with hickory clubs, it's great fun. ""He played all his golf in America and he was a household name there. ""We sometimes get Americans coming here just to see the home of Bobby Cruickshank and people here generally don't give a very good response because nobody is clued up on it yet - but we're aiming to change that. ""He really is the forgotten golfer. He was one heck of a golfer. Bobby Cruickshank deserves his place in history.""",2025-03-10T06:15:05.930Z,Ken Banks and Ben Philip
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2yl1j3g48o,Ukraine's 'high-stakes talks' and 'nonsense planning delays' shake-up," The Times reports that thousands of residents living near new electricity pylons could be given up to £250 a year off their bills for a decade as part of government plans due to be set out this week. The paper says the proposal is intended to reduce opposition to renewable energy schemes, as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer makes a building boom the cornerstone of his push for growth. The i newspaper focuses on the planning bill's aim of curbing the power of administrative bodies to block developments. Its headline says ministers want to ""freeze out 'Nimby' groups to end nonsense planning delays"". The paper says the prime minister realises that despite his recent success on the international stage, voters prioritise domestic achievements. The Daily Telegraph leads on Donald Trump's suggestion that Ukraine ""may not survive"", ahead of the peace talks due to start in Saudi Arabia this week. The paper says he is putting pressure on Volodymyr Zelensky to give up territory to Russia - something Kyiv has said it will do only in return for Nato membership. The Financial Times says President Zelensky will use the ""high stakes"" talks to try to persuade the US to resume military and intelligence support - and to convince Trump he wants a swift end to the war with Russia. ""Prisons to get hundreds more cells in case summer riots happen again"" is the Guardian's headline. It leads on comments by the prisons minister, James Timpson, that there'll be no more emergency measures such as early release schemes. The paper says the government is refurbishing cells and creating makeshift ones, because it wants to avoid a repeat of the lack of space last summer. The Daily Mail headline warns that the ""Woke RAF is running out of top gun pilots"". The paper says the Royal Air Force has launched a desperate search for pilots after a diversity drive, which prioritised women and ethnic minorities, backfired. It suggests candidates who were previously overlooked are being urged to reapply. The Telegraph claims Sir Keir Starmer is facing the biggest rebellion of his premiership, over plans to cut the welfare budget to boost defence spending. The paper says it understands about 80 Labour MPs - around a fifth of the parliamentary party - ""won't tolerate"" the planned raid on benefits expected in the chancellor's spring statement. The front page of the Daily Mirror marks yesterday's Covid Day of Reflection with the headline, ""We must never forget"". Five years on from the start of the pandemic, the paper includes testimonies from the families of victims at a ceremony at the National Covid Memorial Wall in London. The Mirror prints a poem read by the former children's laureate Michael Rosen at an event in Staffordshire. It begins: ""Coughing and coughing, gasping for air. We remember. Empty streets, no cars anywhere. We remember."" And the Guardian, Times and Daily Express all feature pictures of the winner of the Crufts dog show in Birmingham. The Italian whippet, Miuccia, beat 18,000 dogs to be crowned ""best in show"". The Express has a photo of Miuccia receiving a kiss from her handler, with the caption ""leader of the pack"".

But that's not all the week has in store. American TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney’s new book Paper Doll is released, the third season of The Wheel of Time drops, and gamers rejoice as WWE 2K25 is finally here. Read on for this week's biggest releases... If you're a parent, then prepare to be terrified by Netflix's new four-part crime drama series Adolescence, which is out on Thursday. I've had a sneak preview, and can tell you that the opening scenes alone are highly stressful. We see police officers smashing their way into a house, before arresting a 13-year-old boy on suspicion of murdering a female classmate. The visibly distressed boy is then taken to a police station, while his family protest his innocence. This is a one-shot drama, co-created and co-written by Stephen Graham, who also stars as the boy's father. It also features Top Boy's Ashley Walters, and newcomer Owen Cooper. Graham described the plotline as ""an ordinary family's worst nightmare"", while co-writer Jack Thorne told me he hoped it would inspire a conversation ""about technology, about education, about parenting"". You probably know American influencer Dylan Mulvaney from her viral social media videos, detailing her gender transition. The 28-year-old trans actress is now publishing a new book, Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer, which comes out on Tuesday. The book promises an intimate reflection of her life pre and post-transition. Topics include her first break in theatre, and the first time her dad recognised her as a girl. She also touches on the controversy surrounding her sponsored video for Bud Light, which led to a backlash and calls for a boycott of the brand. She told me she hoped the book would ""help folks, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, feel a little more connected to their most authentic selves"". On Thursday, series three of The Wheel of Time drops on Amazon Prime. Based on Robert Jordan's fantasy book series, it stars Rosamund Pike - of Saltburn and Gone Girl fame - who is also executive producer. We're told that in the latest instalment, the threats against the Light (the force of good in the world) are multiplying. Expect good vs evil, magic, destiny and adventure. In short, everything you might want from a thrilling fantasy series. By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter If you've always dreamed of entering a pro wrestling ring but don't fancy the gruelling training regimes, performance schedules or being body-slammed IRL, there's always video games. It's been a year of big change for WWE so far. It's moved its flagship shows to Netflix and recently done the unthinkable and made John Cena a heel (a bad guy). But like clockwork, the popular WWE2K series returns to PC and consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series) on Friday. Fans praised last year's edition of the annual franchise as one of the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be, and reviews say WWE 2K25 has built on that foundation. The faithful might be less pleased by the addition of console-exclusive The Island, a new online option that appears to take inspiration from the controversial City mode in publisher 2K's NBA titles. But for those who want to keep things simple, the developers hope other new modes and the 300-strong roster of WWE superstars old and new will make players say ""Woo!"", ""Oh Yeah!"" and ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"".",2025-03-09T17:59:45.819Z,Noor Nanji
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp06n0d8eo,Not so demure any more: The rise of 'free the nipple' fashion,"Six months ago, a viral TikTok trend made us obsessed with being very demure and very mindful - but now, modesty has taken a back seat among celebrities who have made see-through outfits all the rage on red carpets and catwalks. At the Brit Awards last week, big winner Charli XCX went full brat as she wore a sheer black dress, prompting hundreds of complaints to media watchdog Ofcom. She used one of her acceptance speeches to address the controversy of her outfit. ""I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples,"" she said. ""I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?"" The nearly naked look has been a talking point at other award ceremonies - including last Sunday's Oscars and the Grammys in February, when Kanye West's wife Bianca Censori dropped her coat on the red carpet to reveal an almost entirely invisible dress. The love for transparent textiles has continued at London and Paris fashion weeks, with many of the celebrities watching on also getting the memo. At Stella McCartney's Paris show, US actress and Michael Jackson's daughter Paris Jackson wore a translucent black off-the-shoulder maxi dress with only a nude-coloured thong underneath. Rapper Ice Spice sported a black lace catsuit with a feathered coat at the show. Naked dressing was a key trend in some designers' spring/summer collections, and the theme has continued in autumn/winter looks too. As Vogue wrote in January: ""For a period of time, sheerness was few and far between, but nowadays, 'naked dressing' is commonplace every season."" Dior's latest collection embraced see-through material and presented it in an ethereal way, with intricate detailing and gender-fluid silhouettes. Creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri described her collection as ""demonstrating how clothing is a receptacle that affirms cultural, aesthetic and social codes"". The trend divides opinion but is certainly part of a wider movement - last summer Charli XCX's definition of being a brat included wearing ""a strappy white top with no bra"". Sheer dressing is a nod to the minimalist looks of the 1990s - think transparent blouses and Kate Moss wearing a thin slip dress - and with our love for nostalgia fashion, it's no wonder it is taking off again. The trend also had a resurgence a decade ago. The ""free the nipple"" movement was everywhere in the early 2010s, with Rihanna stirring up headlines with her sheer crystal-embellished dress at the CFDA awards in 2014. Charli XCX's Brits outfit was praised by some on social media. ""Stop policing women's bodies,"" one person wrote, while another said she looked comfortable in her outfit so ""why is society judging?"" But many found it too risque for prime-time TV. Ofcom received 825 complaints about the Brits ceremony, the majority relating to Charli's outfit and Sabrina Carpenter's eye-opening pre-watershed performance. ""Maybe think about putting this on at a time when kids ain't gonna be watching,"" one person wrote on social media. Fashion stylist and CEO of clothing brand Mermaid Way, Julia Pukhalskaia, calls the choice to wear revealing dresses a ""provocative statement"", but says it's a ""way to reclaim the right to govern one's body"". The controversy around it feeds into a wider dialogue about women's rights and double standards when it comes to dress codes, she adds. Abhi Madan, creative director of fashion brand Amarra, believes the trend ""is about embracing freedom and boldness in fashion"". The idea of freeing the nipple ""isn't just about exposure - it's a movement towards body positivity and challenging conventional fashion norms"", he argues. ""Designers are now integrating sheer elements not just for shock value but to create a refined and elegant silhouette that empowers wearers."" It seems many Hollywood stars this year were feeling empowered as chiffon, lace and tulle were in plentiful supply at the Oscars. Shock value is surely a factor for some, too, though. At Vanity Fair's Oscars afterparty, Julia Fox wore a mesh dress with only long wavy hair to cover some of her modesty. There were other interpretations of the naked dress - Megan Thee Stallion wore a green dress with strategically placed foliage and nipple coverings, while Zoe Kravitz opted to cover up the front but expose the back as a beaded mesh panel revealed her buttocks in her Saint Laurent dress. ""This year, naked dressing seemed to particularly thrive at the event,"" the New York Times noted. However, not everyone is on board. The Times fashion director Anna Murphy wrote that she's over the trend because ""it's only women who do this"". ""It is not an equal opportunities endeavour. It is, rather, a manifestation of the kind of thing that keeps this world unequal. That women's bodies are for public consumption and men's, usually, aren't,"" she wrote. Some men have been embracing the nearly naked trend, though. In 2022, Timothée Chalamet wore striking a backless red top at Venice Film Festival, and at the 2023 Grammys Harry Styles freed the nipple in a plunge harlequin jumpsuit. It's the women who will continue to cause more of a stir on runways and red carpets - and society will still be split on whether it's redefining conventional notions of modesty in fashion, a product of misogyny, or simply seeking attention.",2025-03-09T00:10:23.188Z,Yasmin Rufo
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qjn879lr4o,What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?,"The chancellor will give an update on her plans for the UK economy when she gives a statement alongside an economic forecast on 26 March. Rachel Reeves has previously ruled out further tax rises, but faces difficult choices because of the performance of the UK economy and world events. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the government's spending plans and performance, will publish its forecast on the UK economy on Wednesday 26 March. It will also provide estimates on the cost of living for households and whether it thinks the government will stick to its self-imposed rules on borrowing and spending. Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings to Parliament, and alongside this will make her Spring Statement on the economy. After she has spoken, the opposition, likely to be either Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch or shadow chancellor Mel Stride, will respond. Reeves has committed to one major economic event - the Budget - each year, to ""give families and businesses stability and certainty on tax and spending changes"". That means no big policy announcements are made on 26 March, but that's not stopping them being made beforehand. With the economy seen to be underperforming and global factors, such as US trade tariffs, indirectly impacting the UK, there is growing speculation over whether the chancellor will break her self-imposed rules on borrowing. The OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the £9.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029/30 financial year, has been wiped out. Reeves has repeatedly said her rules are ""non-negotiable"". Her two main rules are: Ahead of the Spring Statement, the Treasury has drafted plans for several billion pounds of spending cuts. It is understood welfare spending is in the firing line, but other government departments will also see budgets pruned. The government already had concerns about the rising number of benefit claimants and Reeves has previously pledged ""fundamental"" reform of the welfare system. The Treasury has blamed global economic policy and geopolitical uncertainty over the outcome of conflicts in Ukraine and Middle East, for raising government borrowing costs. Possible other announcements that are being reported include: Government sources have been keen to state that this event is not a major one because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts. A debateable tax hiking policy could be announced, however, if Reeves decides to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax. The policy is known as a hidden tax rise or stealth tax, as it takes effect over time as people are dragged into paying more tax as their pay goes up, without the tax rate rising at all. Thresholds were frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2025, but the chancellor could decide to extend the freeze to raise about £7bn a year, according to consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics and investment bank Citi. Reeves decided not to extend the threshold freeze in her first Budget, arguing that doing so ""would hurt working people"" and ""take more money out of their payslips"". Whether any other spending cuts are announced in the Spring Statement or in the Spending Review in June, or even delayed until the next Budget, remains to be seen. Recent figures show UK economic growth has been sluggish - not shrinking, but not growing as desired. The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, according to the latest official figures. When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services. In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted. The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target, and is forecast to go higher. Inflation could dictate whether interest rates are lowered further from their current 4.5%. Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings. Costs for businesses are expected to jump further in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers. Pressure has also increased on the chancellor's tax and spending plans after a surplus in government finances missed official forecasts, prompting speculation from economists that she could break her fiscal rules as things stand. Borrowing costs for the UK surged in January in part due to concerns over the UK's economic outlook, threatening Reeves's economic plans. The costs have since fallen back but remain higher than this time last year. Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, despite tariffs not directly targeting the UK, would lower growth and raise inflation.",2025-03-09T08:52:16.228Z,Michael Race
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4k35v39e7o,Hope for patients to get 'deserved' answers in abuse inquiry,"It is a ""sincere hope"" that patients of Muckamore Abbey Hospital and their families are given the answers they ""rightly deserve"" following the public inquiry into abuse at the facility. That was according to senior counsel to the inquiry Sean Doran KC in his closing statement on the final day of public hearings. The public inquiry into what happened at the Antrim-based hospital began in June 2022. Mr Doran said the inquiry's objective was to focus on an examination of the issue of abuse, the reasons for its occurrence, and the need to ensure that it does not recur in the future. Since then, there have been 120 sitting days, which have featured oral evidence from 181 witnesses. Mr Doran said there had been a ""substantial"" body of evidence brought before the inquiry panel. That included testimony from families whose loved ones were patients at the hospital, as well as people who worked there. Mr Doran said in so far as was possible, the inquiry sought to hear from witnesses from ""various categories and levels of staff who worked at Muckamore"" and with ""experience on different wards"". In addition to the public inquiry, a separate major police investigation began in 2017 after allegations of ill-treatment began to emerge. Mr Doran said the fact that criminal proceedings were being carried out at the same time as the inquiry had posed ""challenges"". Fifteen individuals are facing prosecution, among them carers and nurses. However he said the inquiry had liaised regularly with the PSNI and Public Prosecution Service, and that appropriate measures had been undertaken to protect against the risk of prejudice against criminal proceedings. ""The inquiry has operated and will continue to operate with sensitivity to the live nature of criminal proceedings that may conceivably extend to some time beyond the life of the inquiry,"" he added. Muckamore is run by the Belfast Health Trust and provides facilities for adults with special needs. Last week the trust said patients' families were ""undoubtedly failed"".

""Visitors will gain an intimate perspective on the design process, from initial sketches to finished garment, that helped define the visual identity of the Royal Family over the past century,"" curator Claudia Acott Williams said. ""Royal and ceremonial dress is very different from fashion, it's not the same as designing fashionable gowns, royal dress is an incredibly performative mode of dress. ""It's designed to tell a story, to create moments of pageantry and spectacle."" Historic Royal Palaces hope the exhibition will give visitors a sneak peak behind the scenes of the work of five of the 20th Century's most important royal couturiers: Madame Handley-Seymour, Norman Hartnell, Hardy Amies, Oliver Messel and David Sassoon. On display is a full-sized working pattern for a completed gown which would be worn by Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) at the coronation of King George VI in 1937 at Westminster Abbey. Known as toile, it is a preparatory garment, by court dressmaker Madame Handley-Seymour, that is cut to the body in a series of fittings. Ms Acott Williams explained that ""it's like a 3D sketch"". ""This is a really extraordinary insight into how such a garment is created and the fitting process as this would have been fitted to the Queen's body,"" she said. Visible on the garment are little tacking threads that Madame Handley-Seymour would have used in the cutting and fitting process, as well as patches of embroidery that have been added during the design process. Madame Handley-Seymour was the favourite designer of Queen Mary of Teck and was recommended to her daughter-in-law, the future Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother). ""As a young woman marrying into the Royal Family she did the appropriate thing and wore the designer that her mother-in-law advised, and she designed her wedding dress in 1923 and then her coronation dress in 1937,"" Ms Acott Williams explained. Sketches for the Queen Mother by Norman Hartnell are also on display. Norman Hartnell would go on to design both the wedding and coronation dresses for Queen Elizabeth II. ""I think that personal relationship was absolutely critical, we know that the Queen Mother and Norman Hartnell had a wonderful relationship, they were very close,"" Ms Acott Williams added. Letters from Queen Elizabeth II to Norman Hartnell are displayed as part of the exhibition showing the direct line of communication between the royal women and designers. Similarly with Princess Diana, sketches by David Sassoon are on display with her handwritten notes, such little ticks and ""this in dark blue please"". ""There is a very personal relationship between them, they would have long fittings at Kensington Palace sat on the floor with fabric samples all over the place."" A salmon-pink silk chiffon dress with bat-wing sleeves, worn by Queen Elizabeth II and created by her royal dressmaker, Hardy Amies, is also on display. She wore it as part of her state visit to Bahrain in 1979 and also to a film premier in London a few months later. ""Hardy Aimes is quite important in ushering her [Queen Elizabeth II] look forward, a slightly more youthful modernity, particularly around bright colours that she was so often seen wearing in later years,"" Ms Acott Williams explained. ""The 70s is a moment of great political and social change and there is a real impetus within the Royal Family to be seen to reflect the times. ""I think she [Queen Elizabeth II] does start to make bolder choices in the 1970s and Hardy Aimes is quite an important person in helping shepherd her through that."" An 18th Century-style blue and gold ball gown worn by Princess Margaret to a charity event at London's Mansion House in July 1964 is another highlight of the exhibition. It was was designed by Oliver Messel who was one of the leading designers for stage and screen, and the uncle of Princess Margaret's then husband - Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon. ""Margaret actually sees his [Oliver Messel's] production of A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1938 when she's less than 10-years-old and she's totally mesmerised by it, and then several years later she marries his nephew and they become incredibly close, and even beyond her divorce they remain great friends,"" Ms Acott Williams explained. ""I hope this exhibition shows the thought, research, craftsmanship that goes into these gowns. They are created by the greatest crafts-people that Britain has to offer. ""We are all familiar with these women and with what they wear but what we wanted to understand more about the people who were dressing them and about how those relationships worked,"" Ms Acott Williams added.",2025-03-09T07:09:20.318Z,Claire Quinn
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2e0lxylewo,Migrant dies attempting to cross English Channel,"A migrant has died during an attempt to cross the Channel in a small boat from northern France to England, French maritime authorities have said. The Kuwaiti national, in his sixties, suffered a cardiac arrest on the boat that was carrying him and other migrants on Saturday, the Pas-de-Calais prefecture said. The boat returned to the beach but despite the efforts of police and medics the man was declared dead at the scene, it added. He is the sixth person to have died while attempting to cross the Channel this year. The boat set off from Calais in northern France on Saturday morning and ""very quickly returned to the beach with a person in cardio-respiratory arrest on board"", the French maritime prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea told AFP news agency. ""This boat set off again once it had dropped off the people who wanted to disembark on the beach,"" it added. Authorities said the boat was ""quite heavily loaded"" but did not say how many people were on board. Home Office figures show that more than 1,600 migrants have crossed the Channel in small boats in the past week, with 51 people arriving on Friday alone. At least 3,720 people have made the crossing to date this year, an increase of 11% on the same period last year. A record number of migrants died while attempting to make the dangerous crossing in 2024. According to the Office for the Fight against Illicit Trafficking of Migrants, 78 people died while trying to reach England aboard small boats last year, the highest number since the first crossing in 2018. The UK and France have ramped up efforts to stop Channel crossings, including intensifying patrols on French beaches, intercepting small boats and apprehending the smugglers who organise the crossings. In a statement on Friday, the Home Office said: ""We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security. ""The people-smuggling gangs do not care if the vulnerable people they exploit live or die, as long as they pay. We will stop at nothing to dismantle their business models and bring them to justice."" On 27 February, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper met her French counterpart, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, to agree a raft of measures aimed at tackling people-smuggling gangs. These include a new specialist intelligence and judicial police unit in Dunkirk to speed up the arrest and prosecution of people-smugglers and training drone pilots to help intercept boats before they reach the sea. French authorities will stop migrants on land but not once they take to the sea.",2025-03-08T22:11:27.287Z,Jessica Rawnsley
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxnwrln72zo,King's Commonwealth message of unity in 'uncertain times',"King Charles is to call for unity and building bridges in what he describes as ""these uncertain times"" of international tension, in a message to mark Commonwealth Day next week. In the annual message to mark the day on Monday, the King will emphasise the value of nations coming together in a ""spirit of support, and crucially, friendship"". The King has become involved in the diplomatic negotiations involving the UK, the US and Ukraine - with the monarch warmly welcoming President Volodymyr Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader's disastrous meeting with US President Donald Trump and with a state visit planned for Trump. A Commonwealth country, Canada, also faces its own tensions with Trump's administration, as he has called for Canada to become the US 51st state. Commonwealth Day is traditionally marked with a service at Westminster Abbey and this year the King and Queen will attend alongside the Prince and Princess of Wales. In his written message, which will be published in full on Monday, the King will say: ""In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship."" It is a message that he has made before - that the diversity of peoples and cultures is a strength and not a weakness. But it is a message now against a backdrop of global tensions, as the US pushes for an end to the war that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As well as a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian President Zelensky, the King this week held a meeting with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, a Commonwealth leader who has faced pressure from the US. King Charles is Canada's head of state and ahead of the meeting Trudeau said: ""Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation."" The King used the Commonwealth, with its 56-member nations, as an example of co-operation between countries. ""The Commonwealth's ability to bring together people from all over the world has stood the test of time and remains as ever-important today,"" says the King's message. The service at Westminster Abbey on Monday will emphasise the multicultural diversity of the Commonwealth, with the royal guests being met by a pipe band from a Hindu eco-temple in north-west London. There will be music from an African arts group, the Masai Cultural Arts team. And singer Joan Armatrading will perform a version of her song, Love and Affection. An innovation for this year's Commonwealth Day has been that the King has prepared his own personal playlist of favourite music tracks, by artists including Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue and Raye.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gx52xqqpo,Bulgarians guilty of spying for Russia in the UK,"Three Bulgarian nationals have been found guilty of spying for Russia, in what police have described as ""one of the largest"" foreign intelligence operations in the UK. Vanya Gaberova, 30, Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, who were all living in London, were part of a group who travelled Europe carrying out surveillance on journalists, a former politician and a US military base in Germany between 2020 and 2023. While the trio had day jobs as a beautician, a healthcare worker, and a decorator, the cell they were part of plotted to kidnap and kill targets, as well as planned to ensnare them in so-called honeytraps. The methods they used were the sort of thing you would ""expect to see in a spy novel"", said the Metropolitan Police's Cdr Dominic Murphy. Gaberova, of Euston, north London, Ivanova, of Harrow, north London, and Ivanchev, of Acton, west London, were convicted of conspiracy to spy, while Ivanova was also convicted of possessing multiple false identity documents. They were working for fellow Bulgarian Orlin Roussev, 47, who ran the spy ring from a 33-room former guest house in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Here police found a ""treasure trove"" of spying gadgets and equipment, including cameras hidden in ties, a camera hidden in a fake rock, and glasses containing recording equipment. They also found a number of Minions cuddly toys, including one which contained a spy camera. Roussev had referred to those working for him as his ""minions"", like the yellow sidekicks of dastardly villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise. Roussev previously admitted conspiracy to spy, alongside Biser Dzhambazov, 43, of Harrow, while a sixth defendant, Ivan Stoyanov, 34, of Greenford, west London, admitted spying before the trial. The cell's key targets were investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, whose work includes exposing Russia's role in the nerve agent attacks on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2020 and Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. As part of the surveillance, Gaberova was instructed to befriend Mr Grozev, with Roussev describing him as ""hooked and in love"" with her in WhatsApp messages. Another operation included carrying out surveillance to identify Ukrainian soldiers at a military site where they were being trained, around the time of Russia's invasion of the country in 2022. During the trial, prosecutor Alison Morgan KC said the spy cell was ""sophisticated in their methodology; carrying out surveillance activity of individuals and places; manufacturing and using false identities and deploying advanced technology to acquire information"". The police investigation received 221 mobile phones, 495 sim cards, 11 drones, and devices allowing data to be extracted from phones and eavesdropping on wi-fi activity. Met counter-terrorism chief Cdr Murphy said the case was an ""extremely sophisticated"" operation that ""posed a threat to national security and individuals"". Roussev received instructions from Jan Marsalek, who is wanted in Germany for his alleged fraud linked to the financial services company Wirecard. The Austrian national was described by prosecutors as an ""intermediary for the Russian intelligence services"". Roussev and Marsalek met a decade ago, with Roussev subsequently recruited as a spy. He then recruited other Bulgarians to undertake espionage operations. Roussev was at one stage the chief technology officer for a city of London financial firm. Stoyanov worked as a medical courier, but also fought in mixed martial arts fights using the nickname ""The Destroyer"". Dzhambazov and Ivanova lived together as a couple and worked in healthcare jobs, but also ran a Bulgarian community organisation that provided courses on ""British values"". But Dzhambazov was also in a relationship with Gaberova – they were found in bed together when police made arrests – and Ivanchev had separately been in a relationship with her in the past. During their trial, Ivanova and Gaberova admitted undertaking surveillance operations but denied knowing it was for the benefit of Russia. Ivanchev did not give evidence during the trial but outlined a similar position during police interviews after being arrested. He was arrested a year after the other five defendants and told police he had several conversations with MI5. The prosecution case focused on six operations carried out by the spies: Operation 1 This targeted the Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev. Marsalek and Roussev exchanged messages discussing their options in relation to Mr Grozev, including the placing of team members in seats next to him on planes. He was followed throughout Europe and properties connected to him were watched in Austria and Bulgaria. The spy cell also discussed potentially robbing him of his laptop and phone and taking it to the Russian Embassy, burning his property, kidnapping him and taking him to Moscow, or killing him. Operation 2 This targeted journalist Roman Dobrokhotov, a Russian national. The cell followed him in various countries, and discussed kidnapping him in the UK and smuggling him out of the country using a small boat. At one stage, Ivanova was so close to him on a plane that she could see the Pin code for his phone. Operation 3 This targeted a man called Bergey Ryskaliyev in November 2021, the court heard. Mr Ryskaliyev is a Kazakhstan national and former politician. He fled to the United Kingdom where he was later granted asylum. There is and was a clear motive for Russia to develop relations with Kazakhstan, the court heard. Prosecutors said that targeting a political dissident on behalf of Kazakhstan cultivates those relations by providing Kazakhstan with what it might consider to be assistance. Operation 4 This involved plans for disruptive activity at the Kazakh embassy in London in September 2022. The court heard that the plan was to stage a demonstration outside the embassy - a ""fake protest"" - to create a pretence that they were in possession of genuine intelligence about those responsible, which they would then pass on to the Kazakhstan intelligence to try to gain favour with Kazakhstan on behalf of Russia. Operation 5 This involved surveillance at the Patch Barracks, a US Military Base in Stuttgart in late 2022. This is a US military airbase, which jurors heard was believed by the defendants to be a location where Ukrainian forces were being trained in the use of surface to air weapons, at the very time of Russia's invasion into Ukraine. Prosecutors say the defendants' plan was to target the airbase using a range of highly sophisticated technology designed to capture key intelligence about those present on the base. Operation 6 Jurors were told this plan was targeting a man called Kirill Kachur. He is a Russian national who spent time in Montenegro who was employed by the Investigative Committee of Russia but left the country in 2021 and was designated as a ""foreign agent"" by Russia in November 2023.",2025-03-07T17:59:37.877Z,Daniel De Simone
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlxx5n5pwdo,Hundreds of horses rescued in memory of animal lover,"Ginny Hajdukiewicz died more than 30 years ago but her legacy lives on, meaning the lives of animals continue to be saved. Ginny was 38 when she died in 1994 after being diagnosed with breast cancer but since then the charity she started has gone on to rescue almost 400 horses and ponies. ""She was my heroine, I was in absolute awe of her and I wanted to be just like her,"" said Dionne Schuurman, who was taught to ride by Ginny as a nine-year-old. Dionne, who is now operations manager at Ginny's charity Lluest Horse and Pony Trust in Llangadog, Carmarthenshire, said Ginny would be incredibly proud as it turns 40. ""She was just one small person and I think her story deserves to be heard,"" said her friend Stella Gratrix, who was one of the charity's first trustees. ""She was a powerful force at 4ft 11."" Aged 23, Ginny set up her first riding centre in Coombe, Gloucestershire. Barbara Metcalfe met her for the first time when she took her then five-year-old daughter along to learn to ride. She said it was immediately clear Ginny was ""absolutely devoted to her horses"". ""She was somebody who cared deeply about the horses and not at all about the money she was going to make,"" she said. Barbara then began volunteering at the centre and a close friendship was formed. Ginny made a similar impression on Stella, who got to know her when she later moved to Wales in 1982 and set up in Trefenter in Ceredigion. ""Ginny survived on bread and potatoes one winter because all of her money went on to buy fodder for the horses, she was totally dedicated,"" she said. ""Her motto was 'every penny possible for the ponies'."" She also remembers Ginny for her strong language. ""A typical horsey lady,"" she laughed. When Ginny founded the charity in 1985, Stella, Barbara and Barbara's late husband Brian were made trustees. She wanted to create a refuge and safe haven for ponies and horses after being appalled by the condition and handling of wild hill ponies and foals she saw at local horse sales. ""We used to go to the horse sales with a camera and it was obviously known what we were doing and we'd have ice cold water chucked over us in February,"" said Stella. ""Ponies would be slipping and sliding because the floor wasn't clean,"" added Barbara. ""It was nothing really to see a foal, perhaps nervous after being taken from its mother, whacked across the back with a stick and then slip and slide all over the slippery floor."" The charity was formed and in her lifetime Ginny rescued 77 horses and helped many more. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992. Towards the end of her life she had a surprise reunion with 22 of the ponies she had rescued over the years, all of them happy, fit and thriving in their loan homes. She died at her home on 13 September 1994 following a stroke and is buried on the farm alongside her beloved pony Prince. Today the charity, which is still funded entirely by donations, has rescued more than 450 horses and ponies. It employs three full-time and two part-time grooms and welcomes volunteers throughout the year. A recent success story is Jack Sparrow, a foal who was rescued after being found alone in a drainage ditch along the sea wall in Peterstone, Newport, last July. He was the third orphan foal the charity took in during 2024 but sadly the only one to survive. Another success story is Connie. During the Covid pandemic in 2020, the charity received a call from a walker to say they had discovered a foal trying to feed from its dead mother close to the charity in Llangadog. Their team had to carry the foal over fences by torchlight before taking her back to the farm for an assessment by vets and feeding her replacement foal milk every two hours through the night. Today she is a happy, healthy five-year-old. Ginny was a keen writer, often writing about her life and work in notebooks or even on the back of envelopes. To coincide with the charity's 40th birthday, Stella and Barbara have collected and edited her handwritten stories. The result is a book - Ginny's story of the Lluest Horse and Pony Trust. Barbara and Stella, who both met Ginny when they were in their 30s and are now in their 70s, said she continued to impact their lives. ""I think she gave me a lot of confidence by doing what I did for her and the trust,"" said Barbara. ""It enriched my life and I've still got a huge respect for her and what she did."" ""Ditto,"" said Stella. ""I still walk up to her grave and say hello."" What would Ginny make of her legacy? ""I saw [Ginny's husband] Peter the other day and he said she would be so proud,"" said Barbara. ""That was his words, he said 'Ginny would be so proud'.""",2025-03-07T06:08:55.184Z,Nicola Bryan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydqygqkl6o,Northern NHS trusts have fewest overseas workers,"Health services across the North East and Cumbria have the lowest number of NHS staff recruited from overseas in England, according to NHS figures. One in five NHS England staff registered a nationality other than British last year, but in the North East and Cumbria it was about one in 10. The data comes as concerns have been raised about over reliance on international workers within the NHS. Katha Deguzman, a Filipino ward sister at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, said working in the UK had been ""incredibly fulfilling"". The number of overseas workers in the North East and Cumbria is the lowest in the country and puts the region within the NHS long term international recruitment aim of between nine and 11% of health service staff. Doctor and nursing roles had the highest percentage of non-British staff members in the area. Miss Deguzman, who moved to the UK in 2018, said she was ""really worried and scared"" about coming to England to work but had since found a second family in her friendly colleagues and patients. ""It was a really friendly hospital,"" the spinal injury ward nurse said, adding: ""I felt like [the patients] would worry because I'm not from here, but I get all the trust of my patients which I'm truly grateful for. ""It's fulfilling for me, being able to extend my help to care for them.""  The region has a lower percentage of non-White British residents compared to the rest of the country. The last census in 2021 found 90% of people in the North East and 95% of people in Cumbria were White British, compared to 81% nationally. Despite the lower than average number of overseas employees, international workers remain significant to NHS provision in the region. At South Tyneside And Sunderland NHS Trust, 18% are non-British, the highest number in the region. The North East and Cumbria Integrated Care Board had the lowest number at 2%, while at the South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 11% of staff are non-British. Debi McKeown, the nursing workforce lead at James Cook, said understanding local dialect could at times be tricky for new recruits but the high level of clinical skills was key in ""sustaining a really healthy workforce"". She said: ""We absolutely had a gap in our workforce here and being able to bring in international nurses has enhanced what we can provide to patients. ""Overseas nurses were really crucial to help us provide safe care to patients.""  Follow BBC North East on X and Facebook and BBC Cumbria on X and Facebook and both on Nextdoor and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jg9ej244do,"The King reveals his playlist, from Marley to Kylie","King Charles III is launching a personal playlist of music that lifts his spirits and brings back important memories, including Bob Marley, Kylie Minogue and Grace Jones. He was photographed at Buckingham Palace for the music project, named the King's Music Room, with an ""on air"" sign on the desk of the royal DJ. A video trailer shows the band for the changing of the guard outside the palace playing Bob Marley's Could You Be Loved, in a project to celebrate music from Commonwealth countries. ""So this is what I particularly wanted to share - songs which have brought me joy,"" the King said. ""Throughout my life, music has meant a great deal to me,"" the King says in the video launching the project, which is a partnership with Apple Music. ""I know that is also the case for so many others. ""It has that remarkable ability to bring happy memories flooding back from the deepest recesses of our memory, to comfort us in times of sadness, and to take us to distant places. ""But perhaps, above all, it can lift our spirits to such a degree, and all the more so when it brings us together in celebration. ""In other words, it brings us joy."" The full choice of tracks, with more royal commentary, will be published on Monday, for Commonwealth Day. As well as as reggae from Marley and dance music from Minogue, there are expected to be contributions from Nigerian-American singer-songwriter Davido and British singer-songwriter Raye. The King saw Raye at a concert at a Christmas market at the former Battersea Power Station, where Apple has its London headquarters. The project is intended to be a different approach to Commonwealth Day, which sees the Royal Family gathering for a service in Westminster Abbey. It will reflect the King's musical interests through his life, ranging from 1930s crooners to Afrobeat stars. He is also expected to share anecdotes about some of the artists and reveals why the songs help form the soundtrack to his life. ""This seemed such an interesting and innovative way to celebrate this year's Commonwealth Day,"" the King said. He has a longstanding interest in Marley and has visited the singer's former home in Jamaica, which has been turned into a museum.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjr99lvp2o,Canal boat crush death was an accident - coroner,"The death of a retired pharmacist crushed between a canal boat and dock was an accident, a coroner has concluded. Margaret Billings, 78, from Penrhyndeudraeth, Gwynedd, was on a boating trip with friends and family when she died along the Kennet and Avon Canal, in Devizes, on 27 June last year. In a written statement, her husband of 51 years, Michael Billings, told Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner's Court they had been on more than 20 trips previously and were experienced - but said he remembered his wife's cry and a splash as she fell into the water. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances and paramedics - including ones from an air ambulance - had tried to revive Ms Billings. The couple were on the trip between Bradford on Avon and Devizes when the incident happened. In the written statement, Mr Billings said they were experienced and confident in the water. The court heard Ms Billings had been helping to moor the boat at Maton Lock, St Joseph's Place, Devizes. She went to jump from the boat to the bank, but did not make it. However, the boat kept going forwards, crushing her, the inquest was told. Mr Billings explained his wife had been standing about 3ft (0.9m) away from him and remembered telling her to wait. ""The next thing I heard was a cry and saw splashing water,"" he said. ""The boat weighed about 20 tonnes and I could see it crushing the life out of Margaret."" He said it had happened very quickly - friends jumped in to pull her put of the water, which was about 4ft (1.2m) deep. Paramedics arrived within minutes and she was pronounced dead soon after, the hearing was told. A couple of days beforehand, she told her husband she had torn her achilles tendon and was limping but had been able to keep up when walking. A post-mortem examination found she died from injuries consistent with being trapped between the boat and the side of the canal. Area coroner Ian Singleton recorded a conclusion of accidental death.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1j881ljyo,Ukrainians share their hopes and fears on the war,"Three Ukrainian women with links to the Channel Islands have shared their hopes and fears after recent discussions about trying to end the ongoing war with Russia. By April 2022 Jersey had welcomed 14 Ukrainian refugees and by March 2023 Guernsey had housed 24 Ukrainians. There were unprecedented scenes in the White House last Friday when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky clashed with Donald Trump and JD Vance in front of the world's media. After the meeting Zelensky was ordered to leave the White House before flying to London where he received a strong show of support from European leaders who are at a Brussels summit to discuss future support for Ukraine. Natalia Baker, born in Odessa and now living in Jersey, said she would love to see victory for Ukraine and celebrate it in Liberation Square ""like how we celebrate the Liberation in Jersey"". While she lives in Jersey, Mrs Baker's family are still in Ukraine. She said: ""We are losing - every day - children, fathers, brothers and mothers so this is tough for us."" Mrs Baker said she believes a ceasefire and peace agreement need to be put in place. ""It doesn't matter that President Zelensky doesn't have a suit - he has a heart,"" she added. Valeriya Sarnovska left Kyiv in 2022 and moved to Guernsey for a few years before returning to her home city where she is currently living. ""Every night I hear the sirens, I feel completely empty,"" she said. ""There are almost no families that have lost no-one to the war."" She said if Ukraine loses international support it ""will disappear and our kids are going to read about Ukraine only in books"". She added that Ukraine needed military help and said that she hoped European pressure would help lead to a resolution. Olga Turkoglu, 36, moved to Guernsey in November 2017. She said: ""Every day we wake up and read the news in the hope that something better has happened."" She said ""so many"" Ukrainians were uncertain about their future but added that her voluntary work for the Humanitarian Aid Guernsey charity gives her a sense of calm when she feels helpless. She said: ""We have cards and our cards are our people and our friends. ""The UK is a good friend and has our back. ""It kind of looks like it's hopeless but knowing that we have those cards gives us hope. ""We stopped the full-scale invasion in 2022, we didn't let Kyiv fall and we still have the belief that we will not stop and we will continue fighting."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgy5vv8y7eo,Woman died climbing on mountain rocks - inquest,"A 28-year-old woman died after falling about 65ft from Tryfan mountain in Eryri National Park, an inquest has heard. Maria Rosanova Eftimova, a structural civil engineer, from St Helens, Merseyside, slipped while attempting to climb rocks with friends on 22 February. Coroner Kate Roberston stated that despite rescue crews and paramedics attending the scene, Ms Eftimova died before she could be taken to hospital. In a tribute, Victoria Critchley, said she was ""ambitious, bright and cherished, whose vibrant personality, energy and aura touched and uplifted all around her"". Tryfan is one of the highest mountains in Eryri National Park – and is often described as a peak that marks the line between hiking and mountaineering and is difficult to navigate in a traditional manner, especially in poor weather. With no marked footpaths to the summit, it requires using hands and scrambling skills to reach the top. It was used as a training ground to test oxygen equipment and safety techniques before the first ever successful climb of Everest in 1953. Chris Lloyd, chairman of Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation, said people should ""check the weather forecast and make sure you are suitable equipped"" before venturing on the mountains. At the opening of the inquest in Caernarfon on Wednesday, Ms Robertson said Ms Eftimova had attempted to reach a ledge for a handhold to lift herself up, but her heel slipped, which caused her to fall a ""considerable distance"". A post mortem examination showed that Ms Eftimova, who is originally from Sofia, in Bulgaria, had suffered severe head injuries, including a fractured skull. She added: ""I send my sincere condolences to all Maria Eftimova's family and friends."" The inquest was adjourned to be continued at a future date.",2025-03-05T13:38:52.447Z,Chris Dearden
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn89656e01do,More funding for judges to tackle record court delays,"Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales. The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed. Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm. The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts. There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood. Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028. The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails. Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court. She said a cap on sitting days had a ""drastic effect"", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog. A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was ""unprecedented"", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem. ""The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,"" she told the Today programme. ""We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,"" she added. But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting. Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt ""out of reach"" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma. One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back. Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under ""immense pressure"" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever. ""With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,"" she said. ""I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first."" Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had ""accepted"" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented. The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors. Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: ""Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned."" Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022. ""We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years."" Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of ""queues for justice"" were ""unacceptable"". ""This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. She added that the state of courtrooms were in ""a pretty dire way"", and funding was also needed for upkeep. ""There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial,"" she said.",2025-03-05T11:07:47.531Z,Dominic Casciani
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crewnnzv8g7o,Flypast and concert for VE Day 80th commemorations,"There will be a four-day celebration of the 80th anniversary of VE Day, including a flypast, concert and a Westminster Abbey service, the government has announced. The commemorations, marking 80 years since the end of World War Two in Europe, will run from the Bank Holiday Monday on 5 May, until 8 May. Veterans will be joining the events, with only a shrinking number of that generation able to attend in what will be among the last major wartime commemorations involving those who served. ""People across society will be able to hear our veterans' stories first hand, to reflect and remember,"" Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said. And it would be an opportunity to ""pay tribute to all those who served in the Second World War and to reflect on the values that they were fighting for"". Ruth Bourne, 98, who worked at the wartime code-breaking base in Bletchley Park, Bucks, will be taking part in the commemorations. She remembers how the war had ended and VE Day celebrations were held on 8 May 1945, when the Nazi regime in Germany had been defeated. ""There was an electric buzz among everyone and eventually the royals came out and waved, and we cheered like crazy waving whatever we had on us,"" Ruth says. ""People climbed on every available lamppost, lit bonfires in Hyde Park and we sat around singing songs. ""Not many went to bed that night."" Defence Secretary John Healey said: ""The freedoms we enjoy today were defended by our remarkable Second World War generation. ""Our duty today is to safeguard the British values they sacrificed so much to uphold."" Tara Knights, of the Royal British Legion, said: ""We will be running educational and community engagement programmes to encourage everyone to get involved in this momentous occasion."" Arts Council England will also be helping communities and local organisations hold commemorative events. It is not yet known which international guests might be attending, including whether US President Donald Trump will be part of the ceremonies. Last year, for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the then US President, Joe Biden, joined commemorations in Normandy, alongside King Charles III, the UK's then prime minister Rishi Sunak, and leaders including President Emmanuel Macron of France, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The previous VE Day events, marking the 75th anniversary, were disrupted by the Covid pandemic. For VE Day 80, there will be four days of events: Later in the year, on 15 August, a service led by the Royal British Legion will be held at the National Memorial Arboretum, Staffordshire, to commemorate VJ Day, or Victory in Japan Day, and the end of the war.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zggp068zo,Fresh bid for Summerland fire inquest submitted,"A formal application for a fresh inquest into the deaths of 50 people in the 1973 Summerland fire disaster has been submitted to the Isle of Man's Attorney General. The Justice for Summerland Group, made up of survivors and relatives of victims, has previously called for the original misadventure verdicts to be overturned. Belfast-based human rights law firm Phoenix Law, representing the families, said it wanted to reopen the case to ""ensure a comprehensive investigation"" using ""modern legal and forensic standards"". The Isle of Man government said the Attorney General's Chambers can confirm that an application has been received and will be given appropriate consideration. About 3,000 people were at the Summerland entertainment complex, which at the time was one of the biggest indoor leisure complexes in Europe, when a blaze broke out on the evening of 2 August 1973, It was thought to have been started by three boys from Liverpool smoking. A public inquiry held in the aftermath found there were ""no villains"" and only human beings who made mistakes. However, making its application, Phoenix Law said there had been an ""irregularity of proceedings in the original inquest"" which had not commented on or addressed ""substantial issues"" including the cause of the fire. The firm said there was ""substantial fresh evidence which was not heard at the original inquest or commission which call into question the central conclusions"", suggesting the forensic analysis of the time was now ""unreliable"". A spokesman also said several experts had provided written support for a fresh investigation into the fire ""on the premise that there have been significant developments within the forensic science on how fires are investigated"". He said they had pointed to the Stardust Fire, in which 48 young people died in a fire in a north Dublin nightclub in 1981, where ""the cause of fire was established many years after the event"". The firm's Darragh Mackin, who last year represented many families affected in the Stardust fire, said the relatives of those killed at Summerland had ""raised concerns about the original investigation"" for years. It was ""difficult to envisage a more compelling set of circumstances to which point firmly in favour of a fresh investigation"", he added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddy9e0ll76o,All smiles in Meghan's upbeat Netflix series,"Blue skies, picture-perfect flowers, intricately-prepared cakes and Californian sunshine streams through the windows. Oh, and another celeb turns up in the kitchen. Is that like your home too? Of course not. And that's the point really. The new Netflix series, With Love, Meghan is about escapism and aspiration, it's a glass of something sparkling on a grey day. We see her standing in a kitchen, albeit not in her own home in Montecito, gathering fruit and herbs in the garden and chatting with friends as she makes food such as focaccia, doughnuts and Korean fried chicken. It's also putting on show food products that are being launched by Meghan's new brand - so there's a lot of raspberry jam on display (on sale with ""keepsake packaging""). What you won't see are references to her former life as a working royal, her children Archie and Lilibet aren't on camera and there's only a fleeting glimpse of Prince Harry. ""I love feeding people, it's probably my love language,"" says Meghan, as she shows her culinary skills. She makes different types of pasta, crudités, focaccia, frittata, baked fish. And with advice on how to make guests feel extra special, she shows how to arrange flowers and make DIY bath salts. There are occasional sprinkles of references to her famous connections. We don't get to see Prince Harry until the final episode, but we hear he enjoys bacon and likes a lot of salt. ""Well I have a family, a husband, who no matter what meal is put in front of him before he tastes it puts salt on,"" Meghan explains. ""So I try to under salt."" Friends drop in. There's the movie star Mindy Kaling, who jokes about the weight of Le Creuset saucepans. Celebrity chef Roy Choi is there. There's designer Tracy Robbins and Victoria Jackson who ran a cosmetics business. It's an eight-part ode to optimism, relentlessly upbeat and feelgood, where parents, rather than clinging to glasses of Friday night white, are standing proudly behind a huge fruit platter beautifully presented in a rainbow design. It's all presented in lush colours, with dramatic shots of the beautiful California coast and mountains. Whether you love or hate the TV series will almost certainly depend on what you think about Meghan. And there will be strong opinions on both sides. It's in an entirely different genre from the previous Netflix documentary from Meghan and Prince Harry, which raked over their angry departure from royal life. Instead we're into a zone of gleaming smiles in polished kitchens, with a soundtrack of positive music pulsing away. ""Love is in the detail, gang,"" she says. And ""it's time to pop a bottle"" for a glass of champagne. Meghan dominates every moment of the 33-minute episodes of this lifestyle TV series, whether it's cooking, gardening, chatting, dancing. Or, as the series begins, beekeeping, as we see Meghan out harvesting honey, dressed in a beekeepers' outfit. And of course there's jam. That was trailed as the first product of her lifestyle brand that has been renamed As Ever. In the show a guest says ""Oh my God"" as he tries the raspberry jam, with the jam appearing through the series. It's also appearing for sale as ""raspberry spread"" in the As Ever food range, which so far doesn't have prices published alongside. Meghan is shown picking blackberries from rows of bushes: ""This is sort of what inspired my jam and preserve making,"" with picking fruit a ""daily task"". The hard work of those bees also seems to be heading for the shops, with ""Wildflower honey with honeycomb"" going on sale. We see a range of teas in the show and As Ever is releasing hibiscus, peppermint and lemon ginger varieties. Shortbread cookies, a crepe mix and flower ""sprinkles"" are also part of the new range. Mindy Kaling jokes about way the jams were first promoted, where celebrities were sent numbered jars by Meghan. ""When I received that in the mail, a box of your preserves it was probably one of the most glamorous moments of my life,"" said Kaling. ""But then I looked at the label, and it said they were something like 50. And then I of course, as a very hierarchical person, was like 'who are these other 50? Does having a lower number make me more special...""' Meghan reveals she saved the number one jar for her mother, Doria Ragland as ""it felt like the right thing to do"". We learn about Meghan's fashion style. She likes ""high low"" fashion, mixing up high street fashions with expensive designers. There's also clarification that her name is Sussex now and not Markle, when she challenges Mindy Kaling over using her maiden name. ""I didn't know how meaningful it would be to me, but it just means so much to go 'this is our family name, our little family name',"" says Meghan. There are occasional glimpses of another life. She mentions: ""I was a latchkey kid, so I grew up with a lot of fast food and TV tray meals."" Even a domestic goddess had to grow up somewhere. She's shown wrapping a gift and says: ""I used to teach a gift-wrapping class when I was an auditioning actress."" As a viewer, you want to pause and find out more about that. But the show rushes on. There's a toughness here. In the final episode we see Prince Harry briefly, congratulating her on launching her As Ever business. And she raises a toast to this ""new chapter"" which is ""part of that creativity that I've missed so much"". Does this series also mark a final departure from any prospect of a return to palace life? The whole breezy, commercial charm of the show is a world away from the royals. This feels like looking forwards to a new future, without any more haggling over the past. Everything that Meghan does gets intense attention. That's partly because of how she polarises opinion. People who think she's wonderful and people who can't stand her are all interested in watching more. This series will inevitably get attention because of Meghan's involvement. But will there be enough for either her fans or her detractors to get their teeth into? How strongly can you feel about a cake with a few raspberries on top? Opinions will be divided. As Ever.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq979yw54xo,Invasive squirrel will 'have to stay in enclosure',"A non-native invasive grey squirrel on the loose in Guernsey will have to remain in an enclosure once caught, rescuers have said. The Guernsey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) said last week the squirrel, named Elvis, ""accidentally"" found its way to the island ""via a vehicle"". Paul Allum, who runs Hitchin Squirrel Rescue in the UK, offered to look after Elvis if it is captured but said the animal would have to stay in a large enclosure outside. He said squirrels were ""classed as invasive species [and] it is against the law to release them"". Grey squirrels spread rapidly in the UK after they were introduced in the 19th Century but Guernsey does not have an established population of the species. Islanders have been told not to gather where the stowaway squirrel has been sighted. Mr Allum said: ""The only concern is not knowing whether it's a female. ""If it's a female, there is a concern that it is baby season now. You never know, she could be pregnant. ""Normally they don't breed 'til after a year old."" Judging from the pictures, Mr Allum said Elvis appears appeared to be healthy and guessed it could be ""a last August baby"". ""It doesn't look too old,"" he said. He said he had been in touch with States of Guernsey veterinary officer David Chamberlain about arrangements for caring for Elvis if it is captured. Mr Allum said: ""Every animal, no matter what, deserves a chance in life."" Details for taking it back to the UK were ""in discussion"", he added. ""They're not sure which is the best way to tackle it, whether it would be by flying or by boat,"" he said. Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x4v4jpp1no,Further ferry delays due to port tidal conditions,"The overnight ferry between the Isle of Man and Lancashire has been delayed by more than two hours due to low tides. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said the Manxman's berthing in Douglas Harbour had been delayed until 10:00 GMT ""due to insufficient water depth"". The schedule for the vessel has faced significant disruption in recent days due to very low spring tides coupled with silting in the harbour. The flagship ferry's morning journey to Heysham has been delayed until 12:00. The government-owned ferry firm previously cancelled its usual afternoon and evening services between the two ports due to the tidal conditions. It follows the temporary grounding of the vessel after its arrival in Douglas on Saturday evening, which the firm said was due to ""lower than predicted"" water levels caused by high atmospheric pressure.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0ej1ljwpo,The families devastated by the terrible cruelty of serial killer Peter Tobin,"On the day police found a second body behind a house once occupied by a murderer, the father of a missing teenager raised his hand, crossed his fingers and said he hoped it was his daughter. Dinah McNicol was 18 when she vanished in 1991, after hitchhiking home to Essex from a dance music festival in Hampshire. Her father had spoken to countless reporters since then and it just so happened that I was interviewing him when 16 years of tortuous uncertainty were coming to an end. Ian McNicol had been left in such a dark place that he wanted his daughter to be the person in a shallow grave, because it would mean the family would finally know where she was, get her back, and lay her to rest. His words laid bare the terrible cruelty of serial killers and they've haunted me ever since. A new BBC documentary, The Hunt for Peter Tobin, explains how the murder of a young Polish student finally solved the mystery of what had happened to Dinah and a second teenager, 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton, who had gone missing in central Scotland six months earlier in February 1991. Tobin was a registered sex offender on the run from the authorities when he killed Angelika Kluk and concealed her body beneath the floor of a Glasgow church in September 2006. He was 60 at the time. The crime was so horrific, detectives were convinced he must have killed before. Strathclyde Police launched Operation Anagram, a nationwide scoping exercise which tried to establish whether Tobin could be linked to unsolved cases around the UK. Within months, officers realised he was living in Bathgate when Vicky Hamilton went missing in the West Lothian town. Despite a huge inquiry and appeals by her distraught family, 15 years had passed with no trace of Vicky ever being found. The link with Tobin changed everything. Forensic scientists re-examined evidence from the time of her disappearance and found DNA from Tobin's son on Vicky's purse, which had been left near Edinburgh bus station. In June 2007, Lothian and Borders Police searched Tobin's former home in Bathgate. In the attic, they discovered a knife which bore traces of Vicky's DNA. Operation Anagram went on to connect Tobin to Dinah, who'd gone missing at the other end of the country in August 1991. Her cash card had been used in towns across the south-east of England, from Hove to Margate and Ramsgate in Kent. The money draining from Dinah's account was compensation she received after her mother Judy died in a road accident when she was six. The police found evidence linking Tobin to the card and established he was living in Margate when Dinah failed to come home. One of Tobin's neighbours recalled ""Scottish Pete"" digging a deep hole in his back garden around that time. Essex Police thought they were going to get answers for Ian McNicol and his family when they went to Tobin's old house at 50 Irvine Drive in November 2007 - but instead of Dinah, they found Vicky. Having covered the search in Bathgate, I travelled south to Margate with a sense of disbelief which was shared by the Scottish officers investigating Tobin's past. Everyone in Scotland knew the face of the smiling schoolgirl with the bobbed dark hair. The discovery of her remains so far from home was horrifying and baffling. How had she ended up there? The answer was that Tobin had killed Vicky in Bathgate, dismembered her body, and taken her remains with him when he moved to a new house 470 miles away in the south of England. In the days that followed, as the police continued their search for Dinah at Irvine Drive, I interviewed her dad at his home in Tillingham, a small Essex village built round a Norman church. Ian was an instantly likeable man in his late 60s; a retired musician originally from Glasgow who'd named his daughter after a jazz standard. Over the years, Dinah's disappearance had taken its toll on his health. We sat down and started filming. ""When I lost my wife, we knew she was dead because we had to bury her,"" he said. ""We went through the normal process of grief. ""When a member of your family goes missing, it's 20 times worse than death because you do not know a thing and all sorts of things go through your imagination."" He was taking some solace from the fact that another family in exactly the same situation had been helped, even though his daughter had not been found. Ian turned to the camera to address Vicky's family and said: ""If you're watching, from me and my family, good luck to you. We wish you all the best."" The doorbell rang. Another reporter told us the police had just announced the discovery of a second body. Ian agreed to continue the interview, raised his right hand with his fingers crossed and said: ""If they've said that, please be Dinah, and get us out of this misery. ""I would bury her next to her mother. So please, let it be Dinah."" Later, after the police confirmed the remains were those of his daughter, Ian said he could die in peace. He passed away in 2014. In the BBC documentary, Vicky's younger sister Lindsay Brown tells of the impact her disappearance had on their mother Jeanette. Two years after Vicky went missing her mother died, her family said, from a broken heart. Archive footage shows Lindsay reading a statement to the media outside the High Court in Dundee in 2008, on the day Tobin was convicted of Vicky's murder, flanked by her older sister Sharon and twin brother Lee. Given all they had been through, what she did that day was as brave as it was difficult to watch. She said: ""Vicky was much more than the girl who was abducted and killed by a stranger or a girl on a missing poster. We will always remember Vicky as she lived, not as she died."" The detectives investigating Tobin's past were certain he had other victims. They did all they could to find answers for other families, to no avail. Tobin took his secrets to the grave and was serving three life sentences when he died in 2022. No-one came forward to claim his body. His ashes were disposed of at sea. When I was interviewed for the BBC documentary, the producer asked what I had thought when I heard the news. I told him I had been pleased and hoped his death hadn't been pleasant. Should I have been that honest? Did it cross a line? I don't know. What I do know is that I'll never forget Ian McNicol or what he said to me 17 years ago: ""Please be Dinah.""",2025-03-04T08:17:11.439Z,David Cowan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y0ld2ngyo,Five things we learned from Meghan's interview ahead of Netflix series,"The Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle TV series has launched on Netflix on Tuesday morning, but an interview with People magazine in the US has already given an insight into what's on the menu. Here are some of the things we have learned: With Love, Meghan is an eight-episode series of cookery, gardening and chats with famous friends. That doesn't always mean fine dining, as the interview says Chinese take-away food is a favourite in their Californian home. ""But even when I get take-out, I will try to plate it beautifully,"" says Meghan. For those already feeling unworthy, she says: ""The series is about doing what you can do... and doing it with love."" They go out to eat too. ""We go to a lot of dinners, and not just in people's homes or private rooms; we just go into the restaurant... I really love that we can just have fun."" Perhaps more reassuringly, Prince Harry and their five-year-old son Prince Archie are keen on fried eggs, says Meghan, who reveals she's usually up at 6.30am. ""I love making breakfast for my family,"" she says. But don't expect to see much of Prince Harry in this series, apparently there's only a glimpse towards the end of the series. As the title suggests, this is about Meghan. This series seems to be seeing Meghan going back to her pre-royal roots, when she had a lifestyle blog, The Tig. But Meghan doesn't see herself as an influencer. ""I see myself as an entrepreneur and a female founder... and if the brand ends up influential, then that's great."" We know that she's launching a new lifestyle product range called As Ever, in a partnership with Netflix, so there could be some entrepreneurial overlaps. ""It's almost like a honeymoon period again,"" says Meghan. Meghan makes working on the show sound almost like a rekindling of their first romance, for her and Harry. ""I see this spark in his eye when he sees me doing the thing that I was doing when he first met me,"" she says. The thing in question was all the work on the blog. ""Scribbling away, writing newsletters, fine-tuning edits and just really being in the details of it. ""I think he loves watching as much as I love doing that creative process. It's just been fun. ""This is who I've always been."" There was a previous podcast, called Archetypes, which faced some tough criticism. The magazine says her new podcast with Lemonada Media is launching this spring. Meghan has had to face plenty of hostility over the years. And in this interview she talks about responding to constant public scrutiny, including over the development of this latest venture. ""There are tons of twists and turns - even with the name,"" she says. ""I was figuring it out in real time."" She added: ""I appreciate everyone who gave me the grace to make mistakes and figure it out and also to be forgiving with myself through that. ""It's a learning curve."" In terms of their own current media consumption: ""We love Shrinking, we just finished Black Doves, and we're excited for the new season of The White Lotus,"" she said. While their last Netflix series was raking over their departure from lives as working royals, this latest series is not expected to go into their disputes with the palaces or the Royal Family. Instead this will be a more upbeat offering, full of expensive kitchens, flowers and sunny views from their new lives in California. It's looking ahead and not back. But for the people of one faraway corner of southern England, there is a nod to their Sussex titles. ""It's our shared name as a family, and I guess I hadn't recognised how meaningful that would be to me until we had children,"" she says. ""I love that that is something that Archie, Lili, H and I all have together. ""It means a lot to me.""",2025-03-04T08:16:24.311Z,Sean Coughlan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjd79xpl02o,King's pivotal role in Trump and Ukraine balancing act,"Before he came to the throne, the then Prince Charles had been challenged over whether he could avoid meddling and stay out of politics when he became King. Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy. He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting. Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an ""unprecedented"" sign of friendship and respect. Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country. It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US. It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations. The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia. With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky. Trump described the King as a ""beautiful man"", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government. The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral. For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the ""indescribable aggression"" against Ukraine, in what he called an ""unprovoked attack on their land"". Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values. He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel. But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation. ""Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,"" said Trudeau ahead of the meeting. Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians. They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president. Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the ""special relationship"" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada. The BBC's Royal Watch newsletter has already had plenty of feedback from Canadians who are angry that the King has not spoken up for them against Trump. ""I am a 73-year-old proud Canadian and loyal royal supporter. Should the King choose a relationship with Trump over support of Canada, I will be changing my support to withdrawing from the Commonwealth,"" emailed Peggy. ""I realise the Royal Family don't usually get involved in politics, but this is different and at the moment many here are wondering why we have a King as head of state at all,"" Ann said in an email to the newsletter. ‌It won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK. It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion. And who was she meeting? A popular young Canadian prime minister called Justin Trudeau. It was seen as a sign of Western solidarity to support Ukraine. Would anyone have believed three years later that he'd be seeking support against the United States?",2025-03-03T13:51:55.944Z,Sean Coughlan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7vz8x8zyyo,Tidal conditions lead to Manx ferry disruption,"Changes have been made to the Isle of Man's ferry schedule after the Manxman became temporarily grounded in Douglas Harbour on Saturday evening. The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said high atmospheric pressure meant the tides were lower than expected, and the vessel became stuck while manoeuvring. Following checks of the vessel by divers, it resumed its services on Saturday with a two-hour delay to its evening sailing to Heysham. However, changes have been made to the timings of the vessel's evening and overnight sailings and cancelled two crossings on Tuesday. Under the amended schedule, the Manxman will sail to the Lancashire Port at 10:00 GMT but will not make its return journey until 01:30 on Wednesday. Infrastructure Minister Michelle Haywood said sediment had been washed into Douglas Harbour by the river, which ""tends to deposit"" in an area where the ferry turn, which had led it to be ""sucked into the mud"". She said a large dredging programme to ""clear away the silt"" was needed and would be investigated, but in the meantime the Steam Packet would continue to amend its sailings to avoid a similar situation during the ""particularly high spring tides"". The ferry firm confirmed the Manxman had become ""stuck on mud for a short time and was not able to continue its berthing operation until the tide came up sufficiently"". It said there had been ""no danger to passengers, crew or the vessel, and throughout the delay those onboard were kept informed of the situation by the master"". Managing Director Brian Thompson said the operator would conduct a review of what happened and it would work with all parties including the infrastructure department's harbours division to ""ensure we don't see a repeat"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62k6zkd3g5o,Deal to buy Prince Andrew's business unravels,"A deal to take over the Duke of York's former start-up business network now seems to be in doubt, sources close to the negotiations have told the BBC. Dutch company Startupbootcamp (SBC) had held talks about buying Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace network, a sale that could have provided him with a multi-million pound financial lifeline. But sources close to SBC say despite an announcement of an intended takeover, and talk of possible funding from Bahrain, nothing has been signed and no transactions have been carried out. It comes as Prince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion after he was cut off financially by King Charles. The prince has to find several million pounds per year to cover security costs and pay for the upkeep of the 19th Century, 30-room house, in Windsor. A lucrative source of income had appeared to be on the horizon, with SBC widely reported in the UK press to be in the process of buying the contacts and network of the Pitch@Palace project. In February SBC announced its plans: ""International investment group set to take over former Pitch@Palace global network."" Pitch@Palace had been a Dragons' Den-style pitching competition for new business ideas, set up Prince Andrew in 2014 and run by him before he stepped down from royal duties in 2019. SBC had said it was attracted by Pitch@Palace's legacy of contacts, with 80,000 applications from 3,000 entrepreneurial companies in more than 60 countries. The Dutch firm, which has been running since 2010, helps to mentor and grow start-up businesses, particularly in the technology sector, with investments in 1,700 early-stage companies and running schemes in 27 countries. A takeover of the Pitch@Palace network had seemed imminent with SBC saying the partnership would be a ""fantastic opportunity"" and that it wanted to make use of a ""great, but dormant"" network of entrepreneurs. Jointly branded events had already been held. But sources close to SBC now say that despite a meeting at Buckingham Palace and a positive sounding press release about seeing ""immense value in the network"", nothing was concluded. No deal with Prince Andrew was ever signed or closed, and no transactions were made, whether in Europe, the Middle East or China, according to SBC's side of negotiations. Prince Andrew has been approached for comment. The plans to take over the Pitch@Palace network had initially been presented as a project between SBC and its ""strategic partner"", an investment company in Bahrain, called Waterberg Stirling. That arrangement seems no longer in place, with sources close to SBC saying it now wanted to ""sever ties"" with the investment firm. Waterberg Stirling had been registered in Bahrain in late 2024 by Dominic Hampshire, an adviser to Prince Andrew. The prince has had longstanding business connections with Bahrain. There are also strong links between the UK and Bahraini royal families, with King Hamad of Bahrain visiting King Charles in Windsor in November 2024. Mr Hampshire is the only named director of Waterberg Stirling on registration documents, but another person linked to the firm has been Adnan Sawadi. In July 2024, the entrepreneur Mr Sawadi gave a presentation in China showing the intended partnership between SBC and the successor to Pitch@Palace, Innovate Global, which he hoped would provide a bridge connecting Middle Eastern funding with projects in China. His speech singled out for praise Yang Tengbo - the man who later that year would be accused of being a Chinese spy, seeking influence over Prince Andrew, claims that Mr Yang has continued to reject as untrue.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74kz9kdpevo,Airline retains patient transfer service contract,"Loganair will continue provide the Isle of Man's patient transfer services for non-urgent hospital appointments in the UK for next three years, Manx Care has confirmed. The regional airline already has the current contract for the service, which sees the Manx government arrange air transport to Liverpool for those receiving treatment in the UK. The health care body's chief executive Teresa Cope said the air links offered ""vital connectivity"" for residents who need treatment that cannot be given on island. Loganair chief executive Luke Farajallah said those travelling for health reasons ""expect the very best care from their airline and the team was ""determined"" to deliver it. The operator took over the service following the collapse of Flybe in 2020, with about 15,000 patient transfer journeys taken each year. The government has contracts with several hospitals, predominantly in the North West of England, which deliver specialist treatment not available on the island, such as transplants, burn care and specialised cancer treatment. The contract, which was awarded after a tender process, involves a minimum daily return service from Monday to Friday, providing flights mainly to and from Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Ms Cope said the flights were important ""lifeline flights"" for the Manx community allowing ""access vital UK services for specialist medical appointments that cannot be delivered locally on-island"". Mr Farajallah said the airline was ""deeply committed to the Isle of Man, its people, and their wellbeing"". It aimed to ensure that ""reliable and dependable flight options"" were ""always available to those who need it most"", he added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ljjk89qy1o,Londoners asked again for views on Oxford Street,"Londoners are being asked for their views on the potential pedestrianisation of Oxford Street. Sir Sadiq Khan hopes that altering the famous shopping street will increase visitor numbers, create jobs, and boost growth for London. The consultation is the mayor's latest attempt to change the street; his attempt in 2018 was blocked by the then Conservative-run local authority. Last year following the general election, the Labour government gave the mayor planning powers to create a Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) around Oxford Street, allowing him to take control of the area away from Westminster City Council. The exact boundaries of the proposed area have not yet been announced as the MDC's formation is part of the consultation. Sir Sadiq said: ""Oxford Street has been known as the nation's high street but the area has suffered in recent years. ""My proposals are designed to unlock the true potential of Oxford Street and deliver a world-class, accessible, clean, avenue. ""These proposals would help to restore this famous part of the capital and support good businesses, while creating new jobs and boosting growth."" Karim Fatehi, CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, urged businesses to participate in the consultation. Adam Hug, leader of Westminster Council, said: ""Subject to the outcome of the mayor's consultation, our role is to ensure that the mayor's proposed Oxford Street transformation delivers for local communities, as well as for London. ""We have already fought hard to secure numerous improvements from the mayor of London to ensure that any plans for Oxford Street are deliverable and meet the needs of local residents, businesses, and wider London."" Dee Corsi, chief executive at New West End Company, a partnership of businesses and property owners in the West End, said: ""We have long championed the regeneration of Oxford Street, recognising its vital importance to London and the UK economy. ""The launch of the public consultation marks a significant milestone in the journey of the nation's high street."" But one London cabbie told BBC London pedestrianisation would be a ""nightmare for drivers"". ""Being a cab driver 26 years this year, Khan is just shutting down London,"" she said. ""He's not thinking about disabled people or anybody that just wants to get in a cab to get home. From a cab driver's point of view, it's very negative. ""From a pedestrian's point of view, it's a win, because it's safe."" An Oxford Street shopper said pedestrianisation ""would make it so much easier for shopping"", while another said it would be a ""bonus"" if it stopped cyclists from using the road.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdryre7y4n0o,Son loses case against parents over move to Africa,"A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school. The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative. He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school ""there would have been no way I would have agreed to it"". But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being ""groomed"" into criminal activity. In a written statement to the court, he said: ""I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible."" In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that ""this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion."" He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was ""driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love"". The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said. He said that the boy's parents believe ""and in my judgement with reason"" that their son has ""at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives"". The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be ""yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London."" The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was ""mocked"" and ""never settled in"" at the school in Ghana. He said he ""could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights"". The boy wrote that he was ""so scared and desperate"" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group. ""I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,"" he wrote. He said he had been ""mistreated"" at the school, adding: ""I'm begging to go back to my old school."" However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London. In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was ""not a punishment but a measure to protect him"". She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was ""every parent's worst nightmare"", she said. She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's ""destruction"". Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited. That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons. She said it was not only the parents who were worried. His school claimed it had ""suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities"" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones. The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor ""involved in gangs in any way"". He said he ""does not know anyone involved in a gang"" and he does not carry a knife. He acknowledged in his statements that ""my behaviour wasn't the best"" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa. The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent. In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: ""This has been a really difficult time for us all."" They added: ""Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family."" James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a ""real shock"" to the teenager. ""He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully."" The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction. The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online. He wrote: ""I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than."" The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well. He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place. The father said they were both very impressed. However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there. The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK. ""Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,"" Mr Netto said. He said he had seen cases where ""in their parents' eyes"" young people were ""falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours"". Following the judgment, he added: ""We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man."" ",2025-02-27T15:35:00.536Z,Sanchia Berg and Levi Jouavel
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zzxeeveeo,UK asylum claims hit highest level since 1979,"The number of people claiming asylum in the UK in 2024 has reached its highest level since records began in 1979, Home Office figures show. According to data published on Thursday, 108,138 people claimed asylum in the year to December 2024 - an increase of 18% on 2023 and almost twice the number in 2021. The Home Office said the previous recorded peak was in 2002. The new high follows an uptick in recorded small boat arrivals in recent years. The number of small boat arrivals also increased in 2024 - 25% higher than in 2023 - but the figure was 20% lower than in 2022. The UK now receives the fifth largest number of asylum seekers in the ""EU plus"" area at a time when the government is under pressure to cut the asylum decision backlog. These figures, which cover the end of the Conservative government and the start of Labour, show the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision fell by 5% last year - with more than 90,600 cases, relating to around 124,800 people, pending a decision as of the end of 2024. The number remains higher than before 2022. The UK also sent more people into immigration detention last year, with that figure increasing by 12%. Meanwhile, the UK returned 2,251 people to another country who had arrived by small boat last year, a 10% increase compared to 2023. There has also been a sharp increase in people granted citizenship - with the figure standing at more than 269,600 in 2024. The prime minister's deputy official spokesman said there were ""no quick fixes"" to the ""global"" problem of illegal migration, but the government had a ""serious long-term plan to restore order to the asylum system"". Border Security and Asylum minister Angela Eagle criticised the previous government for a ""broken asylum system"", saying Labour inherited a ""huge backlog"" of claims. ""We are beginning to get some order to the system but it will take time to make certain that we can get a grip and start making the system work again."" Asked why claims are so high, Eagle said ""many people want to come here"", further referring to those coming on work and student visas and then claiming asylum. She underlined ""we have to be much tougher"" dealing with visa overstayers. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as ""no surprise,"" saying there was ""no deterrent"". Philp added that the blame for the numbers ""lies firmly at Labour's feet, who have been slow to act to tackle the crisis unfolding on our border"". The British Red Cross's policy, research and advocacy director Mubeen Bhutta called for the government to create ""more safe routes"" to prevent people taking dangerous journeys to the UK. ""Behind today's numbers are real men, women and children who have been forced to flee their homes. Too many are making perilous journeys to find safety, because they have no other option,"" Bhutta said in a statement. ""For the vast majority of people, there is no way to claim asylum in the UK without already being here."" New guidance issued for visa and immigration staff earlier this month set out that anyone entering the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey to do so, including those already here, will normally be refused citizenship. The measure was criticised by the Refugee Council as well as some Labour MPs. The Refugee Council said on Thursday it was ""encouraged"" the government continued to work on the ""broken asylum system"" during its first six months in power. However, it called for further efforts to cut the backlog of asylum applications to avoid people ""stuck in hotels, trapped in limbo and unable to work"". The government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers has continued to rise, with more than 38,000 in hotels at the end of December. That figure was still lower than the peak of 56,000 hit in September 2023. The government has pledged to stop this practice by the end of the parliament. The government is legally obliged to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who cannot afford to support themselves while their claims are being considered. But the number of people seeking asylum in the UK has hit record levels, leading to a shortage of spaces in existing accommodation. While irregular arrivals rose last year, the number of work and study visas - which account for a majority of arrivals, not including visitors and transit, examined by the Home Office - dropped. The previous Conservative government introduced measures to reduce legal migration with changes to visa processes – including an increase to the minimum salary for a UK skilled worker visa. The Conservatives also banned health and social care workers and most international students from bringing family to the UK. The number of people coming to the UK on work visas last year fell by about 250,000. This was almost evenly split between fewer people coming for work (down by more than 125,000) and fewer family members coming with them (down by nearly 120,000). Both falls were largely driven by trends in the health and care worker route. The previous government introduced a special visa to bring people into the sector. This led to huge rises in visas issued - especially since people coming to work in care tend to bring more family with them than people coming on other work visas. But Rishi Sunak's government tightened the rules late in 2023, leading to falls in people coming on this visa throughout last year. In September 2024, the current Labour government announced further measures including stronger rules around visa sponsorship of migrant workers. A White Paper is due to be published this year setting out a plan to reduce legal migration. Dr Ben Brindle, researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, referred to a ""boom and bust"" in some visa categories over recent years. ""The large declines in visa grants have been possible primarily because the number of visas previously being issued in the post-Brexit immigration system was so high,"" he said. ""Despite the declines, overall visa grants to non-EU citizens remain well above pre-Brexit levels.""",2025-02-27T14:53:05.456Z,Cachella Smith and Tom Symonds

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05mlp43gnqo,Funds in place for Borders Railway extension study,"A funding package has been confirmed to allow a feasibility study into extending the Borders Railway to go ahead. The UK Department for Transport has committed up to £5m towards the project with that sum matched by the Scottish government. The funding had previously been agreed through the Borderlands Growth Deal but the new UK Labour government wanted to carry out a spending review before releasing its share. It paves the way to appoint a project manager to assess the ""benefits and challenges"" of extending the line beyond Tweedbank and on to Carlisle. The news comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the opening of the line between Edinburgh and the Borders later this year. Both the Scottish and UK governments agreed in 2021 to provide £10m towards exploring the feasibility of progressing the line from Tweedbank to Carlisle.

The charity told the BBC ""an organisation-wide consultation"" has begun and said that ""hard-won rights are being rolled back for marginalised communities across the world"". Only roles with dedicated funding would be safe, Stonewall's CEO Simon Blake told staff in a call on Thursday. When asked by the BBC how much foreign aid spending cuts related to their decision, Stonewall said there are ""a number of reasons for the consultation"". Stonewall has 114 employees, according to the UK charity commission website. The charity's largest funder in recent years has been the Global Equality Fund (GEF), which is overseen by the US state department. It has given Stonewall more than £500,000 between 2021 and 2025. Stonewall's accounts show the GEF granted it £137,254 in 2021-22, £204,442 in 2022-23 and £233,583 in 2023-24. The GEF is a pooled fund from several countries and private business, with a focus on ""advancing LGBTI rights around the world"". But, according to the Times, it has not published accounts since 2015. President Trump is a long-term critic of overseas spending and has said it needs to be brought in line with his ""America First"" strategy. The US government has announced a freeze on funding for aid projects while it undertakes a ""review"" to ensure they align with Trump's priorities. Mr Blake warned about the impact that Trump's policies would have on Stonewall and LGBTQ+ rights globally. ""The work to advocate for LGBTQ+ equality has never been more important and Stonewall is rising to meet the challenge,"" Stonewall said in a statement to the BBC. ""We are seeing an unprecedented political backlash against the principles of inclusion. Stonewall is adapting to ensure that it is fit for purpose and able to meet the challenges of this new political era."" The statement added that ""many charities in the UK are facing tough choices for a range of reasons, including the economic environment. Stonewall is no different"". The charity also said that its work in eastern Europe is ""a good example of the type of project that may cease if funding isn't replaced"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5zlq394dyo,'Windy boat proposal was challenging but worth it',"A man who experienced a ""challenging"" marriage proposal with his now-fiancée in Jersey due to ferry cancellations and access restrictions says it was ""worth it"". Simon Tite, 42, from Coventry, planned to propose to partner Emma Francis, 39, at Plemont Bay on Saturday for their sixth anniversary. But Mr Tite said strong winds led to the cancellation of a ferry from Poole in Dorset and repair work meant they were unable to access his desired beach for the proposal. However, after success when he popped the question on board a boat, he said: ""It couldn't have been any better. Despite the fact it was challenging to get there, it was 100,000% worth it."" Mr Tite said Plemont was Miss Francis's ""favourite place in the world"". He said the pair drove to Poole on Thursday with the intention of catching the Condor Ferry on Friday. He said: ""We got to Poole and all the ferries were cancelled because of the weather. ""I was like: 'I do not believe this'. ""I desperately booked flights for us to come on the Friday from Southampton."" Mr Tite said the proposal plans were met with another obstacle after he discovered access to the preferred beach was blocked off due to repair work. He said he contacted the government's infrastructure department to see if it would allow them to access the beach to walk on it. Officials said no due to safety reasons. Mr Tite said he then arranged a boat ride for the proposal, adding he planned for the pair to swim into the bay He said he hired wetsuits but the rigid inflatable boat (RIB) company said there ""was no way"" the pair could get into the water due to the strong winds. Mr Tite said: ""The wind and the waves were just amazingly massive."" He then popped the question on board the RIB at sea. Miss Francis said: ""I had a face like thunder because I'd been told, in February: 'You're gonna put a wetsuit on. ""Every turn it was: 'Oh, we're not doing this now.' ""I didn't know what was happening at all."" However, despite that the ""bizarre"" experience and eventually realising what was happening, Mrs Tite-to-be said the location was ""perfect"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8y35dl0ylo,Factory closure plans could see 128 jobs lost,"More than 120 jobs are at risk under plans to close a North Yorkshire dairy factory. Milk production firm Arla said it planned to close its Settle site by the end of 2026, putting 128 roles there under threat. The company, which is headquartered in Leeds, plans to move more of its operations to its Lockerbie site in Scotland, including some that are currently based in Stourton, Leeds. Deanne Ferguson from the GMB union said the closure would be ""a devastating blow for the dedicated workers at Settle and for the local community which relies on this key employer"". Arla Foods' vice president of production, Fran Ball, said the company would be entering into a period of consultation with its employees over the plans. Ms Ball said the proposals ""form part of our strategy to strengthen our manufacturing network and futureproof dairy production in the UK"". An Arla spokesperson said it ""remains committed to being a major employer in the Yorkshire region"". The spokesperson said more than 1,000 people were employed in Leeds, including about 500 people at the company's headquarters in Leeds Valley Park and a further 450 people at its dairy in Stourton. No jobs were under threat in Leeds, they added, although about 24 roles would be impacted due to the changes. Last year the company invested £65m investment in its Stourton site, according to the spokesperson. The company said it planned to invest almost £90m into its Lockerbie site, creating 90 new jobs. The plans include creating a UHT milk ""centre of excellence"". UHT and lacto-free milk is currently produced in Settle. Ms Ferguson said the closure would have ""a significant economic and social impact"". ""We will now begin urgent discussions with Arla to explore all possible options to protect jobs. ""We call on Arla and all stakeholders to engage in full and transparent discussions about the future of the workforce and to consider all available alternatives to compulsory redundancies.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp4l170kpo,"Southport attack yoga teacher: 'If I didn't get out, everyone was going to die'","A yoga teacher who almost died in the Southport attack has described for the first time the desperate moments when she helped several children run to safety, despite having been stabbed five times. Leanne Lucas told BBC Panorama how she called 999 as the attacker chased after them. ""I just knew that if I didn't get out, everyone was going to die,"" she said. A 13-year-old helping to run the class, whom we are calling Sarah, also told the BBC that attacker Axel Rudakubana looked ""possessed"" as he stabbed her. Leanne and Sarah are the first survivors who escaped the room to speak publicly. Ten people were injured and three children were killed in the attack last July. Sarah - who is now 14 and whose identity is protected by a court order - was seriously wounded but managed to lead several other children, including her younger sister, to safety. Sitting alongside her parents, she told us how another ""incredible"" girl, who appeared to be only about 10 years old, was keeping other children calm, telling them: ""Don't worry, your parents are going to be here, everything's going to be OK."" The two survivors of the attack, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop, recounted how they had helped others escape the terrifying violence and how neighbours had rushed to their aid. They also revealed how misinformation spread following the attack, including messages on social media blaming Leanne for the deaths. Leanne and Sarah both expressed shock at how authorities had missed warning signs about the attacker. ""It's so shocking how much evidence they had on him, how he slipped through the net,"" said Leanne. ""You see the best and the worst at the same time,"" said Sarah, who described seeing ""the evil side of people"" in Rudakubana's violence and ""all the good of all the community coming together as well to help everyone"". With the mammoth Eras tour reaching the UK, the summer of 2024 was Taylor Swift's summer. So when children's yoga instructor Leanne Lucas and her friend, dance teacher Heidi Liddle, organised a workshop themed around the singer, it sold out within a week. Twenty-five little girls, the youngest five years old, signed up for a morning of dancing, yoga, and making friendship bracelets at the Hart Space studio on 29 July. Sarah offered to help the two teachers and took photos at the event. As the session was drawing to a close, Leanne gathered all of the children together. ""We went round the circle and they said how they were feeling and one of the little girls said: 'This is the best day of my life',"" Leanne said. The girl, nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, died later that night. Seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King were also killed in the attack. Rudakubana, the killer, had arrived by taxi, wearing a bright green hoodie and a medical face mask that covered his mouth. Dashcam footage shows him trying a locked door at the Hart Space before walking through an open doorway and heading up the stairs. Leanne saw the attacker briefly through the window, but she had no idea who he was – or that he posed a threat. The next thing she knew, he was in the room. ""He opened the door and grabbed a child. I don't know what he was doing. I didn't see anything. He then grabbed the next child, and the next child. And then I shout: 'Who is that?'"" Sarah was one of the first to be attacked. ""I saw him stab a child in front of me. And then I saw the knife coming towards me and him coming towards me,"" she said. ""And that's when I saw it go into my arm. And that's when I turned and he must have got my back, but I didn't feel it at the time, because of the adrenaline."" The attacker made his way through the room, before reaching their teacher. ""He moves through the girls by the table and moves next to me,"" Leanne told us, reliving the scene in her mind. ""I just felt something go in my back and my brain just said – he got me."" Leanne suffered five stab wounds – to her spine, her head, her ribs, her lung, and her shoulder blade. Despite this, she managed to get herself and several of the girls out of the room and call the police. ""I just knew that if I didn't get out everyone was going to die,"" she told us, wiping tears from her eyes. ""He was bigger than me. And I just thought: I need to get some help. So we all run towards the door. We were shouting: 'Run!' I called 999 on the landing and I asked for the police."" She said she then saw a flash of green - the attacker's hoodie - ""and I go into panic mode and he's chasing us"". It's clear that more children would have died if the teachers and Sarah hadn't taken the action they did. At Rudakubana's sentencing, the judge said Leanne ""tried to save as many children as she could"" while being attacked, and that ""she did all she could before escaping"". Leanne says: ""The police said we'd all be dead if me and Heidi [fellow organiser] hadn't done what we'd done and that gives nothing for the children who did die... that doesn't take that away."" But like many of those who saved lives that day, she still torments herself. Sarah was left with life-threatening injuries and fractures to two of her spinal vertebrae. ""I remember seeing the girls all like huddling around the stairs,"" she told us calmly. ""So I remember shouting for them to get down and get out. So I was physically pushing them down the stairs to get everyone out. ""I thought that he wasn't going to stop until he killed everyone. I thought that he wanted to kill us all."" Despite her injuries, Sarah managed to lead several other children out of the Hart Space, up the driveway and across the street, where local resident Steve was fixing his garden wall. Sarah told him she had been stabbed and thought she was dying, but Steve reassured her and led the children into his house. ""Everyone was in a blind panic,"" Sarah told us. Steve describes Sarah as ""a hero"". ""She led all them kids away."" He and his wife began taking care of the children. One of the girls who had been stabbed was ""tiny"", Steve recalled, and he could see others were injured too. Meanwhile, James Dixon had heard the screams while working at the garage next door to the Hart Space. ""As a parent, you can tell the difference between a scream of play and a scream of terror,"" he said. ""And this was – nightmares, pain. They were terrified."" A parent was in her car, calling the police, with five or six children in the back. One appeared to be seriously injured. James ran over to another child who had collapsed. ""She asked me: 'Am I going to die?' Which just breaks your heart, but I told her no,"" he said. She was so badly injured he was afraid his reassurance might not be true. ""I focused everything on her to make sure to keep her alive."" James saved the seven-year-old girl's life. Two more workers from the garage, Colin Parry and Julian Medlock, had rushed over to help. They saw Leanne, leaning against a car, ""completely in shock"", said Colin. He asked her if she needed help, but she told him: ""Just look after the girls. Just look after the girls."" ""My brain is going 100 miles an hour but my body won't do anything,"" Leanne recalled. ""And there are people asking me questions and I am saying: 'Go and get the children.' ""I just don't know what else I could have done,"" she said. At the same time, window cleaner Joel Verite had spotted Leanne as he was driving past on his round. He screeched to a halt and saw her point up to the studio, saying that a man was stabbing children up there. Businessman Jon Hayes, who had been working in an adjoining office, had also been stabbed after confronting the attacker. Joel raced inside, shouting as he climbed the stairs. He saw Rudakubana standing at the top of the staircase. ""We locked eyes for a brief second. He's got a knife,"" Joel said. ""My life flashed before my eyes. Who else is with him? Who is going to come behind me?"" Steve had run over from his house, armed with hammers. He met Joel, who had stepped back from the staircase after facing off with the knifeman. ""We had a little chat to ourselves and said, right, are we going to go in and do him or what?"" Steve said. But at that moment, the police arrived. They entered the studio with a Taser, subdued Rudakubana and arrested him. Steve said he saw the police knocking on the locked door of one of the toilets. Inside was Heidi Liddle, Leanne's friend. After helping some of the children escape, she had found an eight-year-old girl hiding in a toilet and had saved her by locking them both inside. It was now noon - the time when the workshop had been due to end - and the street had filled with distraught parents looking for their children. Sarah's dad arrived and saw Joel carrying a child. ""My initial thought was, God - and I just ran for the building,"" he told us. But Steve was telling parents that many of the children were sheltering at his house. There, the door was open and his youngest daughter came out. ""I just gripped tight, ever so hard. She goes, 'I'm fine. I'm fine'."" Still outside the Hart Space studio, Sarah's mum saw ""blood everywhere"". ""There were bloody hands on cars,"" she said. ""When I looked up, I just saw my husband at the end of the street. He was waving me over and I just ran towards him. I just tried not to look at anything or anyone."" Leanne and eight children - including Sarah - were treated for life-threatening injuries. ""I asked someone if I was going to die,"" Leanne said. ""And she didn't say no. She's just said 'you're in the best place'."" Leanne said she heard someone discuss possible paralysis and something about her lungs. Sarah was taken to the same hospital, where her father was told they had had to operate on her lung, which had collapsed from a puncture wound. While Leanne recovered from life-saving surgery, rioting began, first in Southport, then spreading across the UK, following false rumours that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. She said she was targeted on social media by people who blamed her for the children's deaths. ""I just was scared of everybody. And still thinking it was all my fault. If I hadn't arranged the day, if I had never advertised in certain places, if I hadn't used that studio,"" she said. She saw videos of riots taking place on her own street. ""I was like, are they trying to get me?"" Sarah told us ""disinformation"" on social media was one of the reasons she wanted to tell her story - ""to get my voice and the truth out there to everyone"". Others who acted bravely on that day share Leanne's sense of disbelief and turmoil. ""Those screams haunt me,"" says James, who saved a seven-year-old girl's life. ""I'd think to myself, if I ran a little bit quicker, a little bit braver, took a weapon..."" We first met Leanne in January. She had endured six months of waiting for her attacker to be tried. But on the day his trial was due to begin, Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to three charges of murder and 10 of attempted murder. For Leanne, this was another act of malice. ""I found out he pleaded guilty on the news,"" Leanne recalled. ""I felt so angry. We knew he did it. He knew he did it. Every single person knew he did it. And he waited until the day of trial to say guilty and put every single family, victim, witness - everyone in that position."" For many witnesses in the case, Rudakubana's last-minute guilty plea – however manipulative in its timing – was a relief. Many were dreading the prospect of sitting in a courtroom with their attacker while lawyers pored over the details of the injuries he had inflicted. Sarah, however, wanted her day in court, saying she'd had all the ""stress and anxiety"" without the ""closure"". Rudakubana was sentenced to 52 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed because he was 17 years old when he carried out the attack. Leanne said she wanted to speak out now because, even after the court proceedings, she still did not feel the ""absolute trauma"" of that day had been understood. ""I just feel like I am able to be the voice of people you can't hear who are involved in the story,"" she said. On the day her attacker was sentenced, Leanne spoke about the survivor's guilt she lives with. ""I cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died,"" she told the court. She said she was struggling to trust others and trying to see the goodness in the world. ""For Alice, Elsie, Bebe, Heidi and the surviving girls, I'm surviving for you,"" she said. She told us about treasured moments with each of the girls who died. She described Bebe's ""pure excitement"" at holding a puppy during a puppy yoga session. The day of the attack was the first time Leanne had met Alice, and the ""beautiful smile"" of this ""confident ballerina"" left an impression. And she recalled Elsie's enthusiasm for the weekly reading and writing lessons they had together. It is clear that their memory is what keeps her going. ""These children represent goodness, I think. Just pure goodness,"" she told us. ""Happiness. How genuine they were. Positive. The love of life and just making the best out of every single moment. That's how I remember them.""",2025-02-24T05:59:05.478Z,Judith Moritz & Jonathan Coffey

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gyllzj5eo,"William at his lowest after Kate's diagnosis, says ex-aide","A former aide to the Prince of Wales has said the royal was at his ""lowest"" after the Princess of Wales was diagnosed with cancer. In an interview with 60 Minutes Australia, Jason Knauf, formerly the chief executive of William and Kate's Royal Foundation, said: ""It was awful, absolutely awful. It's the lowest I've ever seen him. ""Within a couple of weeks, if you're Prince William, you find out that both your wife and your father have cancer. I couldn't believe it."" Both the King and the Princess of Wales were treated for cancer last year. Kate is now in remission and Charles is having ongoing treatment. Mr Knauf, 43, stepped down from his position at the end of 2021. Catherine's diagnosis was made public in March last year, and Mr Knauf said: ""The problem was that all this crazy conspiracy theory stuff kicked off in the background, online. 'Was she really ill?'. ""But they didn't want to say yet that she had cancer because they hadn't told the children and they were still working through how to tell the children."" Speaking to reporters last year at the end of his visit to South Africa, Prince William, 42, talked about how he has coped after both his wife and his father were diagnosed with cancer, describing the past year as the ""hardest year"" of his life. ""It's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life. So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult,"" he said after being asked how his year has been after a difficult year for the Royal Family."" Mr Knauf also previously worked for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. In October 2018, while working for the couple as their communications secretary, Mr Knauf made a bullying complaint against Meghan. He wrote of his concerns to William's then private secretary in an email, in an apparent attempt to force Buckingham Palace to protect staff. The duchess's legal team strenuously denied the allegation. Discussing William's relationship with Harry, Mr Knauf said: ""It's very difficult to have this stuff play out in the public eye, but he's chosen to keep his thoughts on it private, and I think all of us who know him really have to respect that we should do the same. ""But I will say, of course, it's been hard and sad, especially for all of us who know both of them. ""I worked really closely with the two of them and we had lots of great times."" Mr Knauf has previously expressed regret in not giving evidence in the Duchess of Sussex's High Court case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the Court of Appeal. Meghan won her privacy case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) in 2021, when the High Court found its publication of her letter to her father - sent in August 2018 - was unlawful. Mr Knauf was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (RVO) in the 2023 New Year Honours List. Before joining the royal household the American-born former corporate affairs executive worked for a range of institutions, from the office of the New Zealand prime minister to HM Treasury and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Knauf led a review of the Royal Foundation's role and structure from March 2019, before becoming its chief executive in September of that year. He oversaw the launch of the Foundation's Earthshot Prize - William's £50 million environmental prize, now an independent charity, which recognises solutions, ideas and technologies that ""repair the planet"".",2025-02-23T16:13:10.057Z,Guy Lambert

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8ydr7dg96o,Writer wanted to make Bergerac role 'more complex',"The writer of a Bergerac reboot said he wanted to develop the leading role to make it ""more complex"". The Jersey-based detective series originally ran on BBC One from 1981 to 1991 and starred John Nettles. Toby Whithouse, born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said he had tried to make the show more ""labyrinth"" and wanted to ""test and challenge"" the character of Jim. Set to premiere on 27 February, the new series stars Damien Molony, alongside Zoë Wanamaker and Philip Glenister. The show followed a maverick detective and recovering alcoholic adept at solving complex crimes. Nettles became a household name due to its success and said he was offered a cameo role but turned it down. Mr Whithouse, whose previous work includes Doctor Who, wanted ""to stay true"" to the programme's roots while offering something new. He said: ""I absolutely wanted to do something that was more complex and more labyrinth and also allowed us to then to develop Jim as a character and to test and challenge him. ""So fans of the original will go away feeling like the show has been respected, and new people, who have come with no baggage or expectations, still really enjoy it."" He told BBC Essex the writing process was far from easy as it was unlike anything he had written before. ""I don't really tend to do police procedure shows, I do more high-concept genres. ""I started to have an idea for the main character and how I would write him and reinvent him. ""In the original show, Jim Bergerac was a recovering alcoholic, which is something that I really wanted to use but we've taken it in a slightly different, more realistic direction."" One of the key changes in the modern version is there will be one story per series instead of one story per week. Bergerac is available on U and U&DRAMA from 27 February.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nmzrxnlro,Three arrested over man's 2002 disappearance,"Three people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a man who went missing more than 20 years ago. Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer in Scotland a few months earlier. A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found. Northumbria Police said it had now arrested two men, in their 40s and 50s, as well as a woman in her 40s on suspicion of murder. Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance. Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements. Police are still searching an address in the Coronation Street area which is a location Mr Clive is known to have visited on the evening he went missing. Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries. Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne. His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were ""still in limbo"" as they did not believe he fell into the river. Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said: ""We are doing everything we can to provide Scott's family with the answers they deserve. ""We still believe there could be key information that people know in the local community."" He said: ""I am again urging anybody who lived on Coronation Street at the time of his disappearance, or has information about Scott's movements that night, to come forward.

The wooden seat made in tribute to Warrington man Bill Batcock was pulled into the Irish Sea off Anglesey in December, before travelling 80 miles (130km) and resurfacing on the Cumbrian coast. It was stumbled upon by members of a local Facebook group who tracked down the man's daughter, Helen Wharton, to tell her the bench had been found. ""Dad was such an adventurer, to think he's made a break for it to go on another adventure, it just makes me smile really,"" she said. Ms Wharton said she and her family had ""no idea"" the bench had gone missing during Storm Darragh in December. She said she was shocked to receive a message on social media with an image of the bench wedged between sand dunes on Drigg beach near Seascale, Cumbria, asking: ""Is this yours?"" ""I couldn't believe it, it was all so strange,"" said Ms Wharton, who lives in Padgate, Warrington. The bench was erected on some exposed headland at Bull Bay on Anglesey to commemorate Mr Batcock, a lover of the Welsh coast and mountains, who died of leukaemia in 2018. He asked for the bench to be placed there ""as he wanted to look out across the sea, across the coast and mountains, towards home"", she said. Words from one of his poems had been inscribed on a plaque on the bench, which read: ""For me, it has to be the sea."" Ms Wharton told BBC Radio Manchester the message was now ""quite ironic"" given the remarkable journey of the bench. She said the campaign to return the bench was ""really lovely"", adding the words on the plaque had intrigued local people. Megan O'Gorman, who runs the local Facebook group in which a member messaged to say they had found the bench, said she was determined to track down the family. ""I thought right, who is this person, where has this bench travelled from,"" she said. Ms Wharton said: ""It's just typical if you think of my dad, nothing would tie him down."" She and her family plan to travel to Cumbria on Friday to collect the bench and return it to its home on Anglesey.

A 63-year-old man was arrested in the Stobswell area of Dundee shortly after 07:15 following a raid by specialist officers. Four hours later, a 23-year-old woman was arrested after officers raided a flat in the Hilltown. A 26-year-old man has also been arrested by police in the West Midlands following simultaneous raids in Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Police officers remain at both properties following the arrests, which were made as the result of intelligence gathered as part of the inquiry. County lines is where drugs, including heroin and cocaine, are moved across the country - the 'county line' itself is a mobile phone number where orders are placed for the drugs. Vulnerable adults and children are often used to sell the drugs, with some people moved from their local area to another part of the country to sell drugs, often to pay off a debt. The Dundee raids were carried out as part of Operation Spignel, a joint operation with police in the West Midlands. Dundee-based Det Insp Alan Swanston from Police Scotland said: ""We've identified a serious organised crime group that are operating out of the West Midlands area and drug dealing in Dundee. ""Specialist officers will also develop and assess the intelligence and build a picture of what the group looks like and where they're located."" Specialist resources are also being made available for the operation, including cybercrime officers. Det Insp Swanston said: ""The arrests will allow us to conduct interviews, examine any phones or devices that have been obtained and also be able to go through the addresses with a fine toothcomb to identify if there is evidence that would back up the intelligence.""",2025-02-20T13:13:39.792Z,Graeme Ogston
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzwxd5e0zo,Pylon route power line goes to final consultation,"Consultation on a planned power line that would see a 31-mile pylon route built from Wales to Shropshire has begun. The Vyrnwy Frankton Project, a scheme to build a new substation near Cefn Coch in Powys and connect it to the national network at Lower Frankton in Shropshire, includes underground cables and an overhead line. Six consultation events have been set up in village halls and community centres from 27 February to 8 March by Green Gen Cymru. People will be able to view a digital 3D model of the route, the company said. This is expected to be the final route-wide consultation before a planning application is submitted. North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan has called on the company to consider building the route underground and said communities would be affected visually and by noise. Senior project manager Sean Taylor said the company had considered areas important for tourism and recreation, adding: ""The route is planned to keep effects on these as low as we can, while balancing the effects on the landscape and the environment."" Addressing effects on communities, he said: ""We have carefully considered views to and from villages in designing the connection. As much as possible, we've used woodland and the natural shape of the landscape to help reduce potential visual effects."" Mr Taylor said the project was ""still open to influence"" and the firm was committed to working closely with communities and stakeholders. In Shropshire, consultation events are being held at West Felton Village Hall on 27 February, Hordley & Bagley Village Hall on 28 February and Llanymynech Village Hall on 1 March. Events will be held in Wales at Llanfair Caereinion Public Hall on 6 March, Llansantffraid Community Centre on 7 March and Meifod Village Hall Community Centre on 8 March. The consultation will close on 16 April. Follow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",2025-02-19T13:42:00.976Z,Tanya Gupta
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q4dj31v7o,Fourth firm offers Channel Islands ferry service,"The Channel Islands is set to be served by a fourth ferry firm after operator Islands Unlimited published its inter-island summer schedule. It follows a decision by Jersey and Guernsey's governments to choose different ferry firms to operate their main sea links for the next 15 years, with French firm Manche Iles also offering a passenger ferry. Jersey's government opted for Danish firm DFDS, while Guernsey chose to stay with Condor - both have indicated they plan to operate limited services between the islands, but timetables have not yet been published. Islands Unlimited managing director Chad Murray said: ""We are excited that we will be offering a daily inter-island foot passenger service this summer."" Mr Murray said a standard adult return fare with his firm would be priced at about £67. The firm's schedule offers daily services between Guernsey and Jersey, running from 07:00 until 19:45 on weekdays (other than Tuesdays when it stops at 16:45). It will also run from 07:00 until 21:45 at weekends. Mr Murray said the new summer schedule would be subject to ""some final discussions"" with Ports of Jersey. The firm's boss said: ""We want to meet the needs of the islanders, as well as visitors. ""Following stakeholder engagement, this offers the best fit for the communities, commuters, local business, sport and event, as well as offering great day trips for visitors to support tourism."" Islands Unlimited has said its service could start in June. Chairman of the Guernsey Tourism Partnership, Ant Ford-Parker, said: ""We are delighted that this bold initiative is nearing completion.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjlx2e4l8o,"Anti-Muslim hate at record level in UK, report says","Anti-Muslim hate in the UK surged to record levels last year, an organisation tracking Islamophobia has found. Almost 6,000 reports to Tell Mama were confirmed by it as anti-Muslim incidents, more than double the number two years ago, with men targeted more than women for the first time since the body was founded in 2012. In its report the organisation said there had been a ""surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers"" following the Israel-Gaza conflict and Southport murders. A government spokesperson called the findings ""extremely concerning"" and said it would ""seek to stamp out anti-Muslim hatred and racism wherever it occurs"". A total of 6,313 cases of anti-Muslim hate were recorded by Tell Mama in 2024, a 43% increase on the previous year - with 5,837 of the reports verified by the group. The organisation, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime, said it had documented a steep rise in offline incidents, with 3,680 cases reported - a 72% increase on the number two years ago. The majority of the in-person cases were abusive behaviour, with Tell Mama also recording incidents of physical assault, discrimination and vandalism. Most of the attacks took place in public areas such as streets and parks, with a minority occurring in the workplace. For the first time since Tell Mama's inception in 2012, more men than women were targeted by anti-Muslim hate and Islamophobia, the organisation said. Tell Mama said that shift reflected ""the deepening impact of harmful stereotypes that fuel societal divisions and reinforces false notions about Muslim identities"". Anti-Muslim attacks surged in the UK following both the Southport murders last July and the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict in October 2023. According to the report, more than half of the online incidents of Islamophobia last year took place after three girls were murdered at a dance class in Southport. The majority of these occurred on the social media platform X - formerly known as Twitter. Following the murders, misinformation about the assailant's identity proliferated online, fuelling civil unrest that spread across the UK. Axel Rudakubana, an 18-year-old born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents who had settled in Britain, is serving a minimum 52-year sentence for the murders. Tell Mama said that there had been a ""surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers"" since both the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and the 2024 riots sparked by the Southport murders. Iman Atta, the group's director, called for coordinated action by the government and said: ""As anti-Muslim hate continues to be felt by a greater number of British Muslims, both at a street and online level, our work and support for victims of anti-Muslim hate is needed now more than ever."" The public must ""stand together against hatred and extremism"", she said, and urged those in positions of influence to ""consider how their language risks stereotyping communities and how it unduly influences discussions online and offline"". In response to the findings, the government said that ""attacks on and hatred against Muslim communities are completely unacceptable and have no place in our society"". A spokesperson added: ""We are absolutely determined to bridge divisions between communities and are working closely with community groups, charities, and public sector partners to tackle hatred in all its forms.""",2025-02-19T12:03:03.016Z,Jessica Rawnsley
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0ldgvnx3o,"New knife laws will make difference, says victim's sister","Stricter rules for selling knives online and tougher penalties for those who break them will make a difference, the sister of a teenager killed with a ninja sword has said. The new measures announced by the government will be known as Ronan's Law - after 16-year-old Ronan Kanda who was murdered close to his home three years ago after being stabbed in the back and chest in a case of mistaken identity. ""On the day of my brother's murder, his murderer had no problem with collecting the knives from the local post office,"" Nikita Kanda told Radio 4's Today programme, adding ""no checks"" had been made. It comes as policing minister, Dame Diana Johnson on Thursday pledged all potential avenues will be explored as part of the government's mission to halve knife crime over the next decade. Ronan was killed by fellow school pupil Prabjeet Veadhesa, after he visited a friend's house to buy a PlayStation controller in June 2022. A trial heard his attacker, who was also 16, at the time had mistaken him for his friend, their intended victim. He used a 22-inch sword he had ordered online using his mother's ID to pass security checks. It was one of nearly 30 knives and machetes he had bought using the same method over several months. As part of the new rules which are to be introduced in the spring, retailers across England and Wales will be required to report any bulk or suspicious knife purchases to police. The jail term for selling weapons to under-18s will increase from six months to two years and a new policing unit backed with £1m of funding to monitor for weapons being sold illegally on social media will also be created. Asked about the plans, his sister told the BBC that having some sort of punishment in place was ""better than nothing"", adding there needed to be more accountability for ""people who are a part of the problem but who are overlooked"". ""All I can ever do is reflect on my brother's case, and on the day of my brother's murder, the murderer, he didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office, and the fact that he was under-age, so no checks were performed."" She said: ""So I really do think that these, these measures can make a difference, and they will make a difference because it will make it harder."" She described Ronan as the ""light of our life, the best brother anyone could ask for"". Since her son's death, Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, has campaigned for fundamental changes to the law to make it harder for people to sell and buy knives. ""The online sale of bladed articles played a crucial role in this tragedy. A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people. I knew we could not go on like this."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Kanda said she ""absolutely"" believed her son would not have died if the new legislation had been in place at the time of his death in 2022. ""The murderers would not have been able to get the weapons they were able to get so easily. Nobody was able to stop them, and they were just 16,"" she said. On the new law she said: ""Out of tragedy comes a light. The light we all need."" However, she stressed ""there's so much more we can do"" when tackling the root causes of knife crime. Introduced as part of the government's Crime and Policing Bill in the spring, the rules are in response to a review by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) into the online sale of knives. The changes will also see: Policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said ""nothing is off the table"" in regards to knife crime as she described it as ""absolutely disgraceful"" that retailers were selling knives to under 18s. Speaking about Ronan's death on the Today programme she said: ""There was no check that day when the ninja sword, the 20-inch ninja sword was collected at the post office - nobody checked it."" She paid tribute to his family, who she described as at the ""forefront"" of bringing the bill forward and said the new rules would acknowledge the ""problem"" of supply of weapons, rather than just possession, with ""proper sentencing"". The Home Office said the new measures would significantly tighten the law, which until now has been less stringent than the legislation covering the sale of alcohol, tobacco, fireworks or even scratch cards. ""It is horrifying how easy it is for young people to get hold of knives online,"" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. ""Even though children's lives are being lost, and families and communities are left devastated as a result."" Commander Stephen Clayman, who led the NPCC review into online knife sales, said: ""Bizarrely it is harder to buy paracetamol in some respects than it is to buy a knife - that can't be right. ""We want to make retailers more responsible for what they are selling."" The recommendations also require social media companies to be more accountable for the ""thousands of knives"" that Cdr Clayman said were being sold on platforms. ""They are being quite clever about it in the way they don't overtly sell. But they show all the knives and encourage people to move to a different [online] platform to make the transaction. ""If they are selling knives and we can prove it, we will take legal action and ask for the content to be removed."" The measures are aimed at stopping sellers like Stefan Petrescu from Southampton. He used Instagram to sell hundreds of knives. Police found receipts which revealed that Petrescu had bulk-bought more than £3,000-worth of knives, which he had then sold online. Messages from Petrescu's seized phone showed the use of social media platforms to market the knives, with buyers saying they wanted to ""shank"" (stab) or harm others. In one video, he wears a black balaclava-style mask and gloves while handling knives, advertising his stock of serrated machetes, knuckle dusters and other blades while drill music plays in the background - including the song ""Ready for War"". In October 2024, Petrescu was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to knife-related offences. The home secretary has said the government is on a ""mission"" to halve knife crime over the next 10 years. There were 262 murders in England and Wales involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year to March 2024, according to the Ben Kinsella Trust. Fifty-seven of those killed were under 25.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0lde201jo,Meghan puts new label on jams and lifestyle range,"Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has announced a new identity for her lifestyle brand, which will be called As Ever. Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end. On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month. ""'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'"" said Meghan's post. The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig. She said that the new venture would be ""beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday"". Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website. The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it ""limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area"". That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery. But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title. If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at £7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at £6.95. The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows. ""Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam,"" said Meghan. ""But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it."" The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March. It is five years since Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as working royals, becoming financially independent in the United States. Meghan says in her social media post, she has ""poured my heart into"" this forthcoming product range. Meghan divides public opinion, with strong reactions on social media from supporters and opponents. Her fans have saluted her independence and creativity, while her opponents have already labelled the brand as ""whatever"". Appropriately, she signed off her own post: ""As ever, Meghan.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm177dewnno,House search after man disappeared 22 years ago,"Police investigating the disappearance of a man more than 20 years ago are searching an address he visited on the night he vanished. Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer, Scotland, a few months earlier. A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found. Northumbria Police officers are conducting searches at a property in North Shields' Coronation Street, alongside door-to-door inquiries. The current occupant, who moved in after 2002, had been found alternative accommodation, the force said. Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance. Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements. Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries. Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne. His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were ""still in limbo"" as they did not believe he fell into the river. Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said he was determined to provide the family ""with the answers they deserve"". ""After a review of the information we have, we are refocusing our efforts in the Coronation Street area and an address we know he visited on the night he went missing. ""We are grateful to the current occupant of that premises for their cooperation, and that of the wider community as we conduct our enquiries.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8977l253lo,"'Tough on crime' policies behind prison crisis, says review","Successive governments trying to look ""tough on crime"" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests. The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending. The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were ""knee-jerk"" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action. Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026. ""It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity,"" Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report. Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high. The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding. It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring. The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built. Mr Gauke said: ""Last year we were confronted with the consequences of decades of haphazard policy making and underinvestment in the criminal justice system - bringing it to the brink of collapse. ""For too long politicians have operated in a vacuum, increasing sentencing for individual crimes without considering the knock-on impact on the wider system."" He said the system had failed victims, and that while punishment would always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, ""prison is not the only form of punishment"". Figures show that almost six out of 10 offenders jailed for less than a year go on to break the law again - a cycle of criminality that had been feeding more and more people into the prison population. In contrast, fewer community sentences have been handed out by courts and there has been decades of under-investment in probation teams, who are charged with offenders in the community, and proven rehabilitation programmes. As a consequence, more money has been spent on emergency overcrowding measures, including building more jails, rather than on punishment in the community and cheaper programmes aimed at stopping offending in the first place. Mr Gauke's review found that the prison population began to balloon as Labour and Conservative administrations competed to introduce tougher and tougher measures aimed at jailing people. ""Over the last 25 years, the political landscape has been increasingly dominated by a 'tough on crime' narrative that has focused on longer imprisonment. In tandem, politicians have implemented legislative and policy changes which have inflated sentencing,"" it reads. Mr Gauke told the BBC that the last 30 years have seen ""something of a bidding war between political parties as to who is prepared to lengthen sentences the most"". ""As a consequence, we've seen our prison population essentially double over that time,"" he added. ""We now have the highest incarceration rate in western Europe and with that comes consequences, not least the fact that prison is pretty expensive.""",2025-02-18T10:43:09.077Z,Dominic Casciani
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7y1n73ngo,Kate and children show drawing skills by sharing portraits,"The Princess of Wales and her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, have revealed their artistic skills in four portraits of each other. It's believed to be the first time that a drawing by Catherine of one of her children has been shown in public - with a picture of her six-year-old son, Prince Louis. The royals drew the portraits as ""a moment of connection"" to ""spend time looking at and focusing on one another"" while being creative, a social media post from Kensington Palace added. The pictures are a follow-up to Catherine's recent visit to the National Portrait Gallery, as part of her early years education project, Shaping Us. The princess had joined a class of five-year-olds going around an exhibition encouraging children to portray themselves and to understand their own emotions. The four pictures have been issued without revealing the artist and subject - but the more grown up work would appear to be Catherine's picture of a sleeping Prince Louis. Catherine studied A-level art at school and then history of art at St Andrews university. Prince Louis has already shown his own creativity, with the recent release of his photograph of his mother wrapped up warm on a cold winter's day. These latest pictures, like Louis's photograph, were issued on Prince William and Catherine's social media account. A picture of Catherine sitting in an armchair seems likely to have been drawn by 11-year-old Prince George, while another portrait of Catherine with multi-coloured hair seems to be the work of nine-year-old Princess Charlotte. The bright red portrait by Prince Louis could be either Catherine or Charlotte. The pictures are highlighting the exhibition launched by the princess at the National Portrait Gallery in London, which encourages children to think about their relationships and feelings. The princess travelled to the gallery in a school minibus and helped the young visitors as they took part in art activities, intended to help them develop emotional skills. ""These skills are key throughout our lives, shaping who we are, how we manage our thoughts and emotions, how we communicate with and relate to others, and how we explore the world around us,"" said the message on social media, alongside the pictures. ""Drawing portraits with children can provide a moment of connection as you spend time looking at and focusing on one another, as well as being creative,"" the post continued. There is a long tradition of painting among the royals, with King Charles an enthusiastic painter. He has also been the subject of numerous works, including Jonathan Yeo's portrait last year, with its striking shades of red.

The operator added that Saturday's £7.4 million Lotto jackpot had also been claimed by a single ticket-holder. Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at Allwyn, said: ""It's been an astonishing weekend of millionaire-making, which promises to keep me and my team very busy.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgeg5gp4dno,Union and bishops criticise small boat refugee citizenship ban,"A key union has joined faith leaders and charities in warning that a policy banning refugees arriving on small boats from gaining UK citizenship could ""breed division and distrust"". Fresh guidance states anyone entering the UK illegally having made the dangerous English Channel crossing - on a small boat or hiding in a vehicle, for example - will be refused citizenship. Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, and nine Church of England bishops are among 147 signatories of a letter, seen by the BBC, to the home secretary urging her to rethink the policy. They wrote that the government must instead focus on ensuring refugees ""are welcomed and integrated into British life"". The Home Office says the government has merely strengthened rules that were already in place on who could obtain citizenship. The letter argues that citizenship is ""not just a legal status"" but ""a tangible fulfilment of the promise of safety, dignity, and opportunity"". ""When refugees become citizens, they feel a greater sense of belonging as full members of their communities with a stable future for themselves, their children and generations to come."" Referring to a riot at a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham last August, it says that part of the response to that violence ""should be on creating integrated communities"". It went on: ""Labelling refugees, who through no fault of their own have had to put their lives at risk on flimsy vessels, or have had to hide in the backs of lorries to reach safety on our shores, as a type of second-class individual will simply breed division and distrust. ""It risks playing into a toxic politics that pits 'us vs them' and is then manipulated by the far right to bring hate and disorder to our streets."" As well as Ms McAnea of Unison - Labour's most generous union backer in the 2024 general election campaign, donating £1.49m - other signatories include the bishops of Chelmsford, Leicester, Gloucester and Dover. The chief executives of the Refugee Council and Refugee Action have also signed it, alongside Islamic Relief UK and other faith leaders, including rabbis from the Conference of Liberal Rabbis and Cantors. The government's new policy means anyone applying for citizenship from 10 February, having previously entered the UK illegally will be refused regardless of how long ago they arrived. Previously, refugees who arrived via irregular routes would have to wait 10 years before being considered for citizenship. It has also been criticised by Labour MP Stella Creasy. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""There are longstanding rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship. ""The government is strengthening these measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused.""",2025-02-16T18:37:42.652Z,Lauren Turner

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn57vx6vx2po,Flights cuts 'no reflection on airport' - minister,"A reduction in flights between the Isle of Man and the North West of England was ""no reflection on the island's airport"", the infrastructure minister has said. She said EasyJet's schedule changes were not based on how the the facility was ""managed or run but was rather a ""business decision"" made by the firm, she said. The airline is set to reduce flights between Ronaldsway Airport and Liverpool and Manchester between April and November following a fall in demand. Michelle Haywood said while she was ""comforted"" the carrier would continue to serve the island, she ""understands the frustrations"" of those whose travel plans had been disrupted. An EasyJet spokesman previously said the airline continually reviewed its schedule across its network ""to align with demand"". While its flights to London Gatwick and Bristol have been unaffected, in April the airline will run up to 12 flights a week to and from Manchester, and 10 flights a week to and from Liverpool. Haywood said there had been a ""real difference"" in the types of flights the airline wanted to provide, and ""by adding 33 new routes from the UK into Europe they need the planes to be elsewhere"". ""Some of the take-off and land journeys have been a casualty of that change, its easyJet's decision to make, its unfortunate the Isle of Man is losing out slightly,"" she said. But the minister said the Strategic Air Services Policy, which was recently passed by Tynwald and maintains an open skies policy, allowed the island ""freedom to negotiate with airlines to explore new route"".

""Back home taking care of our babies, and missing my Valentine,"" Meghan wrote on social media, saying she was ""beyond proud"" of his sports event for disabled and wounded veterans. The Prince and Princess of Wales also put out their own social media message, with a single heart emoji and a picture of the couple holding hands and kissing. The picture of Prince William and Catherine was particularly poignant, as a still from the video that she had issued last September alongside an announcement that she had completed her cancer treatment. It's a slightly retro-image, with autumn colours and Enid Blyton shorts, taken in woodland in Norfolk and showing Prince William kissing Catherine. Prince Harry and Meghan are also kissing in their picture on social media, in a black and white photo of the couple behind what could be the two dishes linking the US and the UK, with a burger and fries and fish and chips a culinary marker of their own transatlantic ""special relationship"". Meghan added the tag #lovewins to her Valentine's message and signed off ""As ever, M."" There's also another important part of the romantic mood, with what looks like a big glass of red wine. Although as far as can be seen, neither of the couples had bought a bunch of garage flowers on the way home and laboured over a witty message.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8p3dd5ez3o,'Trapped in our home' - Doorbell camera captures neighbour's abuse and threats,"It's the early hours of the morning in March 2024 and Ben is woken by shouting and swearing. It's aimed at him, and he says it feels threatening. It's the woman who lives in the flat below. An hour before, Ben could see and hear threats on the screen of his doorbell camera. It's been rung multiple times and he says he's barely slept. This is the 78th incident on a meticulous log Ben has been keeping since the anti-social behaviour started about a year before. He says he's been ""abused"" and ""physically threatened that we would be shot, stabbed and have our knees broken if we leave the house"". He says he now lives in a constant state of fear. Ben bought the ex-council flat in Wandsworth almost three years ago and around six months later, Drina Gray moved into the flat below. He says the issues began soon after. As well as threats, he says he and his girlfriend Emma are plagued by noise from her flat below, including the tenant's dogs barking, music, shouting and vacuuming all through the night. He says the disruption even affected his ability to work. ""Because I was so sleep-deprived, I was getting to work quite late. I couldn't focus on my job. Ultimately due to just so much stress, so much anxiety, I lost my job."" Ben eventually got a new job but says he's been left feeling ""really helpless"" and says the whole experience has had a detrimental impact on his mental health. Emma adds that she too has been left ""terrified"". ""We just feel trapped,"" she says. Ben and Emma are not alone in experiencing anti-social behaviour. According to the latest official data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 36% of people experienced or witnessed anti-social behaviour last year, up from 34% the previous year. Ben is a leaseholder in a council-owned block and says many of his complaints to Wandsworth Council went unanswered. He says he feels ignored, despite mentioning concerns about mental health and violent threats. Ben and Emma have called the police to their address more than 20 times and say while local neighbourhood officers have been helpful, they feel failed by the system and ""let down"" by response times when they call 999. In August, an official review panel - made up of police and public officials - found there had ""not been good communication between agencies"" and ""none of the agencies has taken ownership of the case"". Wandsworth council has accepted it ""could have acted more swiftly."" Ben has now complained to the housing ombudsman. Over the last year, across the UK, the Housing Ombudsman has ruled that of the 809 anti-social behaviour cases he has presided over, 67% of social landlords hadn't dealt with the issue to an adequate standard. Richard Blakeway, the Housing Ombudsman, said: ""Anti-social behaviour can cause unimaginable distress to people, have a profound impact on the community, and be complex for landlords to manage."" He added that he repeatedly sees cases where ""failures prolong issues and leaves residents feeling unheard and continuing to suffer"". The BBC showed some of Ben's footage to Baroness Helen Newlove, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales. ""It shows that the system isn't working, once again, to protect innocent people,"" she says. Baroness Newlove's husband Garry died in hospital after being attacked outside his home in Warrington, Cheshire, in August 2007 by three youths after he went to speak to a gang he believed had been vandalising his wife's car. She says 17 years later, agencies still don't understand the impact anti-social behaviour has on victims. She fears it will take another death for it to be taken more seriously and for it not be treated as ""low-level"" crime. She says her inbox is full of complaints from victims about anti-social behaviour. Baroness Newlove hopes new powers in the Crime and Policing Bill, being drafted this year, will improve protection for victims. In December, Ben's neighbour, Drina Gray, pleaded guilty to charges including harassment and criminal damage and will be sentenced in March. Ben says the anti-social behaviour has continued and Gray has been rearrested multiple times since. She returned to the flat after the first arrest but the BBC understands she is temporarily staying elsewhere as per her bail conditions. The council says following the court case, it is now seeking possession of the property. But Ben says he has no idea when Gray will be permanently moved. In a statement, Wandsworth Council said it ""takes criminal and anti-social behaviour very seriously, and we work with partners to both support residents and to take the appropriate action against those responsible. ""This is a complex case where housing officers have been working closely with a number of different agencies, including the Police, to resolve the matter."" A spokesperson for the Met Police said: ""Any form of anti-social behaviour is taken seriously and we work in partnership with local authority colleagues to ensure that issues raised are addressed"". Addressing Ben and Emma's specific case, the spokesperson said the police were working to ""ensure that the offender is brought before the courts when there is evidence to support it"". The BBC contacted Drina Gray for comment.",2025-02-14T18:07:28.730Z,Tarah Welsh
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d5j8ejyyro,Sports teams charter travel amid ferry uncertainty,"A sports team in Guernsey said it has had to charter its own boat for inter-island matches because of uncertainty over ferry sailings. It follows months of uncertainty over what schedules will be offered between Guernsey and Jersey by Danish firm DFDS and Brittany Ferries. Sponsorship director of Guernsey Raiders RFC, Chris Gnapp, said they had taken the ""financial risk"" of chartering a boat for the rugby union team. DFDS previously said it was still finalising its schedule and it had been delayed during a legal challenge over the tender process by rival firm Brittany Ferries. The BBC has contacted both DFDS and Brittany Ferries for comment. Mr Gnapp added: ""We have had to take the financial risk of chartering this boat over because there is simply no other way of getting our training teams over to Jersey to play rugby."" Meanwhile director of Guernsey Netball, Sally Carns, said the lack of certainty about travel had been a ""logistical nightmare"". Ms Carns said: ""We can't allow any supporters to travel because we booked out all the flights for that day. ""On the Sunday, we have had to charter a plane, which, again, the financial risk of not filling it sits with ourselves as a charity. ""Logistical nightmare is the phrase of the week."" She said questions were being asked and discussions were going to be had. During the coming summer months, there is expected to be a third ferry service provided by Islands Unlimited, which has said it will offer a daily foot-passenger service. Chad Murray, managing director, said: ""From what we found, there is a strong desire to have consistent, regular travel between the islands."" Mr Murray said teams had been working on the new ferry service for about 18 months. He said there was demand for services ""that allow long day trips to each of the islands, not only for tourists and visitors, but also for island communities"". Mr Murray added the current owners of the vessel it planned to use were still operating it, so they were negotiating an ""exact date"" of when it would be released. He said it would be ""unreasonable"" to set the booking system live until they had confirmation on the date, adding he hoped it would be live in two to three weeks.",2025-02-14T14:05:41.056Z,N/A

Mika, a three-year-old Tibetan Terrier from Guernsey, claimed the hearts of islanders at the Trinity Royal Showground in Jersey on Saturday. Her success now means she will be placed in the open bitch class at Crufts, regarded as the ""world's greatest dog show"" by organisers. Mika's shared owner Chrissy Le Moignan said the category ""means she's against the big girls now, so what will be will be."" Mika has attended Crufts each year with this year's show taking place at Birmingham's NEC between 6 and 9 March. Discussing Mika's temperament, Ms Le Moignan said: ""She loves the show ring, she's an absolute dream. ""She's a monster outside the show ring but put her in the ring and she knows what to do. She's a real showman and she loves it."" Mika's title-winning performance on Saturday meant she was able to follow in the paw-steps of her half sister, who won the same title two years prior. Discussing the win, Mika's other shared owner and vice president of Guernsey Kennel Club, Paige Le Moignan, said: ""I'm absolutely ecstatic, we didn't expect it at all in any way, shape or form. ""You should never go into any competition expecting to win it but everyone is there for the same reason, everyone wants to win, and we were absolutely astounded when she won."" The Channel Island Dog of the Year award is decided over the course of 10 shows throughout the year, four in Guernsey and six in Jersey. In order to quality for the final show, a dog must win its group. ""To get an invitation for the event is huge anyway,"" said Ms Le Moignan. ""There was strong competition throughout, there were comments from the Jersey chairman and the judge himself that there had been really strong competition."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3zr8p46eo,"Explosive-laden caravan plot was a hoax, say Australian police","A caravan found packed with explosives in outer Sydney earlier this year was part of a ""fabricated terrorism plot"" concocted by criminals, Australian police have said. The caravan, which was found in north-western Sydney on 19 January, contained enough explosives to produce a 40m-wide blast, along with a note displaying antisemitic messages and a list of Jewish synagogues. Its discovery, following a spate of antisemitic attacks in Australia, triggered widespread panic. But on Monday, Australian Federal Police (AFP) revealed that they knew ""almost immediately"" that the caravan was ""essentially a criminal con job"". AFP's deputy commissioner of national security, Krissy Barrett, said investigators within the New South Wales Joint Counter Terrorism Team believed that the caravan was ""part of a fabricated terrorism plot"". Authorities arrived at that belief based on information they already had, the ease with which they found the caravan and the visibility of the explosives contained inside – as well as the fact that there was no detonator. Yet police refrained from telling the public that they believed the plot was fake ""out of an abundance of caution"", as they continued to receive tip-offs about other related terror plots. They are now confident that these tip-offs were also fabricated, Ms Barrett said. The fake caravan plot involved several people with different levels of involvement, according to police. Between them, they had planned to purchase a caravan, load it with explosives and antisemitic materials and leave it in a specific location, before informing law enforcement about ""an impending terror attack against Jewish Australians"". Ms Barrett described it as ""an elaborate scheme contrived by organised criminals, domestically and from offshore"", adding that the leader of the plot maintained a distance and hired alleged local criminals to carry out parts of the operation. That individual is a known organised crime figure, Ms Barrett confirmed. She also added that while no arrests had been made in relation to the incident, police have a number of ongoing targets both in Australia and offshore. ""Too many criminals are accused of paying others to carry out antisemitic or terrorism incidents to get our attention or divert our resources,"" Ms Barrett said. She also noted that police believe ""the person pulling the strings wanted changes to their criminal status"". Criminals in these kinds of scenarios often leverage the exchange of information into law enforcement for some kind of personal gain, mostly around sentence reduction, Ms Barrett explained. BBC News contacted AFP for more details on the suspected agenda of those behind the caravan hoax, but received no further comment. ""Regardless of the motivation of those responsible for this fake plot, this has had a chilling effect on the Jewish community,"" Ms Barrett said in her statement. ""What organised crime has done to the Jewish community is reprehensible, and it won't go without consequence. There was also unwarranted suspicion directed at other communities – and that is also reprehensible."" Separately, New South Wales police arrested 14 people on Monday morning as part of Strike Force Pearl: a police operation established in December 2024 to investigate antisemitic hate crimes across Sydney. The establishment of the Strike Force followed a string of antisemitic attacks in Australia in late-2024, including the vandalism of a Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs and the arson of a childcare centre, which was set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages. Speaking to the media on Monday, police said they believed all those incidents had a ""common source"" with the caravan plot. ""The caravan job was orchestrated by the same individual or individuals that were orchestrating the Pearl incidents,"" said NSW Police deputy commissioner David Hudson. Mr Hudson further noted, however, that ""none of the individuals we have arrested during Pearl have displayed any form of antisemitic ideology."" ""I think what these organised crime heads have done is play to vulnerabilities in the community,"" he later explained. ""Obviously there have been antisemitic attacks of a lower nature, and a lot of anger and angst in the community – we've seen that since October 7th, 2023... And I think these organised crime figures have taken an opportunity to play on the vulnerability of the Jewish community.""",2025-03-10T11:24:06.549Z,Gavin Butler
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8y3xgkpw9o,Mass blackouts in storm-hit eastern Australia,"Hundreds of thousands of people remain without power in Australia after a cyclone brought wild weather to the east coast. Communities in southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW) were beginning the clean-up on Sunday after the storm caused widespread flooding and knocked down power lines and trees. A 61-year-old man's body was recovered from floodwaters on Saturday, while in a separate incident, 12 soldiers were taken to hospital after their convoy crashed en route to rescue operations. The storm had weakened by the time it made landfall near Brisbane on Saturday night, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday warned locals of the continued wild weather and risks from flooding. ""The situation in Queensland and northern New South Wales remains very serious due to flash flooding and heavy winds,"" Albanese said. ""Heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts and coastal surf impacts are expected to continue over coming days."" Cyclone Alfred had hovered for days off the country's east coast as a category two cyclone before weakening into a tropical depression on Saturday. By Sunday evening, emergency services had conducted over a dozen rescues in Queensland and NSW - most involving people trapped by rising waters in their cars or homes. The NSW State Emergency Service reported receiving more than 6,000 calls for help. Almost 290,000 properties in the affected regions remain without power, and energy companies have warned residents the blackouts could persist for days. Police said on Saturday they had discovered a body in the search for a 61-year-old man who went missing on Friday after his car was caught in floodwaters in Dorrigo, northern NSW. Emergency responders witnessed the man escaping his car and climbing onto a tree near the riverbank, but rescuers were not able to reach him before he was swept away. In a separate incident on Saturday, 12 soldiers were injured in a convoy crash in Lismore, about 200km south of Brisbane, as they were on their way to rescue and recovery efforts. The soldiers were still in hospital on Sunday, two of them in a serious condition, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told a news conference. ""We wish a speedy recovery for all of those young soldiers,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0jrkv7k29o,Teen armed with gun overpowered by passengers onboard plane,"Police in Australia have charged a 17-year-old who got on a plane with a shotgun and ammunition. He was filmed being wrestled to the ground by passengers and crew as the aircraft prepared to take off from Avalon Airport, near Melbourne, carrying 160 people bound for Sydney on Thursday afternoon. Police believe the teenager got onto the airport tarmac by breaching a security fence, before climbing the front steps to the plane, where he was tackled to the ground near the front door. The 17-year-old - who has not been identified - was taken into custody and will appear in youth court to face eight charges. Among them are unlawfully taking control of an aircraft, endangering the flight's safety and creating a bomb hoax. Victoria Police said a bomb specialist had to be brought in to search a car and two bags which were located nearby. Footage published by Australian outlet 7News showed the suspect being restrained by a passenger, while a member of ground crew and a pilot removed a utility belt containing tools that the suspect was carrying. The pilot can also be seen kicking the shotgun away from the teen, who is wearing a fluorescent jacket. ""How is this possible?"" someone onboard can be heard saying in the footage. Victoria Police said the 17-year-old, who is from the nearby Ballarat area, was being held in custody. Superintendent Michael Reid told reporters that passengers had noticed the teen was carrying a gun as he climbed the steps up to the plane. ""The male was overpowered by three of the passengers, at least,"" he said. Supt Reid said the local force was in contact with counterterrorism police but that it was too early to establish a motive. ""No doubt this would have been a very terrifying incident for the passengers,"" he said, while commending the ""bravery"" of those who had overpowered the suspect. Barry Clark, one of the passengers, told Australian public broadcaster ABC that the teen appeared to be dressed like an airport worker and was ""agitated"". He said: ""All I could do was get the gun out of the way... and then put him in a hold and throw him to the ground until the police came."" No one was injured during the incident, police said. Investigators located a car and two bags belonging to the suspect nearby. Avalon Airport is exclusively served by Jetstar, a budget airline operated by Qantas. In a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News, the company said it was working with authorities to investigate the incident. ""We know this would have been a very distressing situation,"" a statement read. ""We are sincerely grateful to the customers who assisted our crew to safely manage the situation.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv4jd7nje3o,Second nurse charged over video threatening Israeli patients,"A second Sydney nurse who allegedly appeared in a video that made threats towards Israeli patients has been charged by police. Ahmad Rashad Nadir, 27, and Sarah Abu Lebdeh, 26, were both suspended from their duties at Bankstown Hospital in February after the video was released online. It was filmed on an anonymous online platform which pairs people randomly for a chat. Authorities say there is ""no evidence"" the pair actually harmed patients. Mr Nadir was charged on Wednesday with using a carriage service to threaten, menace or harass, and with possessing a prohibited drug. Carriage services refer to modern communication systems such as phones and the internet. Ms Lebdeh was charged last week with three offences: threatening violence to a group, using a carriage service to threaten to kill, and using a carriage service to harass or cause offence. Neither person has entered a plea to the charges, but Mr Nadir apologised last month through his lawyer. In the footage, which appeared to have been filmed inside a hospital and was published by an Israeli content creator, Ms Abu Lebdeh and Mr Nadir allegedly bragged about refusing to treat Israeli patients, killing them, and said they would go to hell. The video spread widely online and caused public outcry, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese describing it as ""disgusting"" and ""vile"". Earlier this month Australia passed tougher laws against hate crimes following a wave of unrelated antisemitic attacks. In recent months, there have been a series of arson and graffiti incidents involving homes, cars, and synagogues in Jewish communities across Australia. There have also been rising incidents of islamophobia.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c625ldpy7yxo,Body found in floodwaters and troops injured in Australia storm,"Australian authorities say a body has been found in floodwaters and 13 military workers injured in a vehicle crash as wild weather from a tropical storm lashes the country's eastern coast. Cyclone Alfred, which was downgraded to a tropical low on Saturday, made landfall near the Queensland capital city of Brisbane in the evening local time. Officials have warned residents to stay indoors and remain vigilant, saying the storm's threat is ""not over"". Winds have brought down trees and power lines and flooded low-lying roads. More than 300,000 properties are without power in the region. Police said on Saturday they had discovered a body in the search for a 61-year-old man who went missing on Friday after his car was caught in floodwaters in Dorrigo, northern New South Wales (NSW). Emergency responders witnessed the man escaping his car and climbing onto a tree near the riverbank, but rescuers were not able to reach him before he was swept away. Police found a body in the area on Saturday and said it ""is believed to be that of the missing man"". In a separate incident on Saturday, 13 military personnel were injured in a convoy crash in Lismore, about 200km south of Brisbane, according to Federal Defence Personnel Minister Matt Keogh. One truck overturned while driving on a narrow road. A second truck then collided with it. The state's ambulance service had earlier said it treated 36 people in the accident. Keogh clarified to media that while around 36 people were involved, only 13 were injured. They had been part of military crews deployed to Lismore, near the Queensland border, to help rescue and response operations. ""Our ADF [Australian Defence Force] heroes were on their way to help Australians in need,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement noting some had been ""seriously"" injured. Albanese earlier on Saturday had addressed the nation from the capital Canberra, saying millions of residents were ""well-prepared"" but ""we must remain vigilant."" Four million people across Queensland and northern New South Wales were bracing for the storm's landfall with dozens of weather warnings in place across both areas. Around 287,000 customers are experiencing outages in south east Queensland, according to energy provider Energex, while Essential Energy said more than 42,600 homes and businesses in New South Wales had experienced blackouts. People in Brisbane, Queensland's capital, went to bed on Friday bracing for strong winds and heavy rain. They woke up on Saturday to learn that the cyclone had been downgraded and the city would escape the worst of the weather. But the danger's not over in other parts of southeastern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Along the Gold Coast, pummelled by bad weather the past few days, conditions have been very strong with driving rain and strong winds. Hundreds of trees have been blown over in gardens, parks and along the main roads. There has been lots of debris and emergency services had sectioned off areas most at risk. ""This emergency is not over,"" said New South Wales state premier Chris Minns, adding that it was ""crucially important"" the public did not ""dismiss"" the storm. ""It really doesn't matter to us whether it's been downgraded from a tropical cyclone to a weather event,"" he said. The state's emergency service operations commander, Stuart Fisher, warned people not to be ""complacent"" and said authorities in the region expect flooding to continue over the next few days. As the storm has edged closer to landfall, nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled. Flights are not expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest. The BBC spoke to several people from Brisbane's homeless community, who took refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, which had become a round-the-clock shelter. At the Treasure Island Holiday Park in the Gold Coast, just north of Surfer's Paradise, a gum tree had come down between two cabins, damaging a third. Nearby, a boat was half submerged in one of the canals a block away from the beach. On the coast itself, many paths down to the beach are now unpassable. Instead, there's a sudden drop to the ocean where the powerful waves have eaten away at the sand. But the clean-up operation won't happen for a few days – the wind is still powerful and there's driving rain. Residents are starting to venture out to look at the damage, but plenty are remaining indoors to keep themselves safe.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyj34d9w3xo,Day centre a refuge for the homeless during ex-Cyclone Alfred,"Residents across the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales have been waiting anxiously as a tropical storm - downgraded from Cyclone Alfred - crawls towards them, leaving thousands in the dark. Four million people are in the firing line of what was thought to be the region's first tropical cyclone in 50 years. Tens of thousands were told to evacuate ahead of the storm, which is expected to make landfall on Saturday. Most have taken heed of warnings to stay indoors - taping up their windows and strapping down garden furniture - while shops have lined sandbags in front of their doors. Ex-cyclone Alfred's path slowed in recent days, with one meteorologist describing it as a ""walking pace"", which sparked fears of prolonged rain and flooding. In southern Brisbane, a popular city in Queensland, some from the homeless community have taken refuge at Emmanuel City Mission, filling the floor on rows of inflatable air mattresses. The space, usually a day centre for people needing a shower or a hot meal, has become a round-the-clock shelter. The BBC spoke to people at the centre when the tropical storm was still categorised as a cyclone. Operations manager Tim Noonan told the BBC that most government-funded charities in the inner city of Brisbane have shut down since Thursday, leaving limited options for those in need. It may be the first time in a long while that homeless people - who typically live in tents in parks or along riverbanks - have a proper resting space, he said. ""It's counter intuitive...but this is the best they've been looked after. They've got somewhere to sleep. ""For a lot of them, this would be the first time in 10 years they've had an eight-hour sleep in air conditioning, going to bed on a full belly, waking up, getting a barista coffee and a bacon and egg burger,"" he said. Mr Noonan said he hoped the cyclone would highlight the need for better funding for organisations such as his. ""We'd love for when the cyclone passes, that these people don't become invisible again,"" he said. Lauren Gorman was spending her second night at the centre with her dog Charcoal. ""I live on the streets, we have a housing crisis, and now we have a cyclone. This place has been amazing for finding other people who are doing it rough and getting information,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm not scared, but I am worried for others who are still on the streets."" While the authorities have warned for days about the cyclone, some die-hard surfers have instead seized the opportunity to ride the high waves. Federal MP Anika Wells, whose Lilley electorate is in the north of Brisbane, said complacency is the biggest risk - especially as the arrival of what was then categorised as a cyclone, kept being pushed back. ""We're going door to door in some suburbs, where people are being asked to evacuate, but lots of people aren't going because this is a once-in-50 year event, and it's hard to take that notice to evacuate seriously, perhaps, when the sun is still shining in your backyard,"" Wells told the BBC. Now a tropical storm, winds are set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast. On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury, from the Bureau of Meteorology, warned of the ongoing risk of severe weather, explaining that ""24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days."" She told ABC News Breakfast that ""rain is still coming through in full force... [with] widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well."" Flash and riverine flooding is the biggest concern especially in low-lying areas. Some residents have been told they could be without power for days, with more than 230,000 households currently in the dark. Nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5dym4ye30o,Australia host loses job over offensive women's football remarks,"An Australian radio presenter has left the network after comments he made about the country's women's football team – which have been branded as misogynist and disrespectful. Marty Sheargold said on nationwide radio station Triple M that the Matildas players reminded him of ""year 10 girls"" and implied that their matches were boring. He apologised earlier on Wednesday, and was due to be back on air but did not appear in his usual time slot. Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of Triple M, later said Sheargold and the station had agreed to ""mutually part ways"". In a statement on Wednesday, Sheargold said that he fully understood the gravity of his remarks and would like to ""sincerely apologise to the Matildas and the broader organisation"". The company said that it ""takes its responsibility to listeners, shareholders, and clients seriously and its programming should align with the standards and expectations of its audience."" ""Right now, it's clear this is a moment for reflection and review. Triple M, and the wider SCA network, will continue to take all necessary steps to support staff,"" the firm's chief content officer Dave Cameron said in a statement. Earlier the sport's governing body said the remarks ""diminish the extraordinary achievements"" of a team that were semi-finalists in the women's world cup in 2023. During his drivetime show on Monday afternoon, Sheargold interjected during a sports bulletin - which was discussing Australia's defeat to the US in its second consecutive loss in the SheBelieves Cup. ""You know what they remind me of? Year 10 girls,"" Sheargold said, to the laughter of his co-hosts. ""All the infighting and all the friendship issues... Now I'm sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that's what I think of it."" When his colleague mentioned the SheBelieves Cup by name, Sheargold interrupted saying: ""Oh, she believes in what? It better be men."" And when reference was made to Australia hosting the AFC Women's Asian Cup next year, he said ""oh god - the Asian Cup"", before criticising the event with an obscene comment. He then asked his co-host: ""Got any men's sport?"" Sheargold's comments later went viral. Minister for Sport Anika Wells called the comments ""boorish, boring and wrong"". ""Australia's most watched television event ever was the Matildas World Cup semi-final; the Tillies' quarterfinal is the second-most-watched event in Australian history,"" Ms Wells said. Australian Olympian Ambrosia Malone, who represents her country in hockey, also criticised Sheargold. ""All I could think about was the young girls sitting in the car with their parents, maybe on the way to or from their own training sessions hearing this,"" she wrote on social media. ""I'm sure many of them would have been hurt and confused… I was in disbelief. ""This is apparently acceptable on mainstream afternoon radio??? HOW??"" Football Australia said it was ""deeply disappointed by the unacceptable comments"" which ""fail to recognise the profound impact they have had on Australian sport and society"". ""This incident is a stark reminder of the responsibility media outlets and personalities have in fostering respectful and constructive discussions about women's sport and its participants,"" it added.",2025-02-26T08:31:24.184Z,Simon Atkinson
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8710r5v0p7o,"Neighbours cancelled again, two years after revival","Beloved Australian soap drama Neighbours has been cancelled again, two years after it was saved by Amazon MGM Studios. Without specifying a reason, Amazon confirmed the series will finish at the end of 2025 - 40 years and more than 9,000 episodes after its television debut. It was dropped by Channel 5 in 2022, but revived by Amazon for its streaming platforms just four months after a star-studded farewell episode watched by millions. The soap - which helped launched the careers of Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie - has long been a huge hit with Australian and UK audiences, and last year received its first Emmy nomination. A statement on the show's social media said the soap would be ""resting"" from December. ""Audiences all around the world have loved and embraced Neighbours for four decades and we are very proud of the huge success over the last two years,"" executive producer Jason Herbison wrote. ""We value how much the fans love Neighbours and we believe there are more stories of the residents of Ramsay Street to tell in the future,"" Mr Hebrison added, hinting that the producers will again hunt for a new backer. New episodes will continue to air on Amazon Prime Video and Australia's Channel Ten four times a week until the end of 2025. In a statement, Amazon MGM Studios said it was ""proud"" to have played ""a small part"" in Neighbours history. ""Forty years is an incredible milestone,"" a spokesperson said. Fans vented their disappointment at the decision. One wrote on social media: ""I refuse point blank to accept that they will try to take @neighbours from me AGAIN!!! It's sometimes the only 20 minutes in the day I can escape. Absolutely blooming well not!!"" Someone else wrote: ""I can't begin to count the number of times I've logged into @primevideouk to be greeted by #Neighbours sitting at the top of the weekly charts. ""Now @amazon have cancelled the soap. At least a few of us will save money when we cancel though, right?"" Another said: ""Will be so sad to say goodbye again, the joy & comfort this show has given for 40 years."" Set and filmed in Melbourne, Neighbours was first broadcast in Australia in 1985 and launched on BBC One a year later. The show has lately featured more diverse characters and storylines, amid questions over how well it reflected modern Australia. It featured the first same-sex marriage on Australian TV. It also had its controversies, however. A number of actors recently came forward with racism allegations, prompting production company Fremantle Media to promise a review. News of the show's cancellation comes after actor Ian Smith - who plays Ramsay Street stalwart Harold Bishop - last year announced he would leave the show, revealing he has terminal cancer. It also follows cutbacks elsewhere to TV soaps, including to the numbers of episodes of British shows Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks.",2025-02-21T09:24:18.801Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21j341m31o,Woman's deepfake betrayal by close friend: 'Every moment turned into porn',"Warning: Contains offensive language and descriptions of sexual violence It was a warm February night when an ominous message popped into Hannah Grundy's inbox in Sydney. ""I will just keep emailing because I think this is worthy of your attention,"" the anonymous sender wrote. Inside was a link, and a warning in bold: ""[This] contains disturbing material."" She hesitated for a moment, fearing it was a scam. The reality was so much worse. The link contained pages and pages of fake pornography featuring Hannah, alongside detailed rape fantasies and violent threats. ""You're tied up in them,"" she recalls. ""You look afraid. You've got tears in your eyes. You're in a cage."" Written in kitschy word art on some images was Hannah's full name. Her Instagram handle was posted, as was the suburb she lived in. She would later learn her phone number had also been given out. That email kicked off a saga Hannah likens to a movie. She was left to become her own detective, uncovering a sickening betrayal by someone close to her, and building a case which changed her life - and Australian legal standards. The web page was called ""The Destruction of Hannah"", and at the top of it was a poll where hundreds of people had voted on the vicious ways they wanted to abuse her. Below was a thread of more than 600 vile photos, with Hannah's face stitched on to them. Buried in between them were chilling threats. ""I'm closing in on this slut,"" the main poster said. ""I want to hide in her house and wait until she is alone, grab her from behind and... feel her struggle."" It's been three years now, but the 35-year-old school teacher has no trouble recalling the ""pure shock"" that coursed through when she and partner Kris Ventura, 33, opened the page. ""You immediately feel unsafe,"" Hannah tells me, eyes wide as she grips a mug of peppermint tea in her living room. Clicking through the website Kris had also found photos of their close friends, along with images depicting at least 60 other women, many also from Sydney. The couple quickly realised the pictures used to create the deepfakes were from the women's private social media accounts. And the penny dropped: this was someone they all knew. Desperate to find out who, Hannah and Kris spent hours at the kitchen table, identifying the women, searching their social media friends lists for a common link, and methodically building a dossier of evidence. Within four hours, they had a list of three potential suspects. On it, but immediately discounted, was their close friend from university Andrew Hayler. The trio had met while working at a campus bar, and the staff there quickly formed deep friendships. And Andy, as they called him - the supervisor - was the glue of the group. He was considerate and affable, Hannah says - the kind of guy who looked out for women in the bar and made sure his female friends got home safely after a night out. They all hung out regularly, went on holidays together, loved and trusted each other. ""I thought of him as a very close friend,"" Hannah says. ""We were just so sure that he was a good person."" But soon they'd whittled down the list to just one name: his. When Hannah woke the next morning and went to the police station, mingling with her shock and horror was a ""naive"" sliver of optimism. ""We thought they'd go grab him that afternoon,"" Kris says with a wry smile. Instead, Hannah says she was met with disdain. She recalls one New South Wales Police officer asking what she'd done to Andy. At one stage they suggested Hannah simply ask him to stop. Later, they pointed to a picture of her in a skimpy outfit and said ""you look cute in this one"", she says. New South Wales Police declined to comment to the BBC on the specifics of Hannah's case. But she says the way her complaint was handled made her feel like she was making ""a big deal out of nothing"". ""And for me, it felt quite life-changing,"" says Hannah. Any faith she still held that police would help quickly dwindled. Amid delays, she turned to Australia's eSafety Commissioner, but under its powers as a regulatory body it could only offer help in taking the content down. Desperate, the couple hired a lawyer and commissioned a digital forensics analyst to move things along. In the meantime, to avoid tipping Andy off and to keep themselves safe, they retreated inwards. ""The world for you just gets smaller. You don't speak to people. You don't really go out,"" Hannah says. Intense fear and loneliness filled the void instead. ""We'd already had to suspend complete belief to understand that he'd done these things, so [the idea of] him actually coming to try and rape you or hurt you isn't that much of a bigger stretch."" The couple installed cameras all around their house and set up location tracking on Hannah's devices. She began wearing a health watch 24/7, so someone would know if her heartbeat rose - or ceased. ""I stopped having the windows open because I was scared... maybe someone would come in,"" Hannah explains. ""We slept with a knife in both of our bedside tables because we just thought: 'What if?'"" Still feeling abandoned by police, Kris had taken on the burden of monitoring the site for the slightest sign of escalation towards Hannah and any of their friends - who, to protect the investigation, still did not know anything. Guilt ate at the pair: ""We had a constant battle about whether it was right to not tell them,"" Hannah says. At one point told the investigation had been suspended, Hannah and Kris forked out even more money for a detailed forensic report, and threatened to make a formal complaint to the police watchdog. All up, they spent over A$20,000 (£10,200; $12,400) trying to protect themselves and stop Andy. Finally a new detective was assigned and within two weeks police were raiding Andy's house. He admitted everything. Filled with relief, then dread, Hannah began calling her friends to break the news. ""My stomach just dropped,"" Jessica Stuart says, recalling the moment she learned what Andy had done to her photos. ""I felt really violated but… I don't think I fully comprehended."" For her, again, the sucker punch was that a friend who she loved like ""family"" was behind the crime. Andy had always appeared ""so unassuming"" and ""really thoughtful"" - someone she'd called for help through a difficult time. ""It's been really hard to reconcile that those two people are actually the same person."" The case was uncharted territory for Australia. For at least a decade, experts have warned advances in technology would lead to a wave of AI crimes. But authorities have been caught on the back foot, leaving deepfake victims - overwhelmingly women - vulnerable. At the time Andy was arrested in 2022, there was no offence for creating or sharing deepfake pornography in NSW, or anywhere else in Australia, and the country had never seen a case of this magnitude before. The 39-year-old was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence - a low-level catch-all offence for many internet crimes - and Hannah was warned to keep her expectations low. ""We were prepared to go to court and for him to get a slap on the wrist,"" she says. But she and the 25 other women who decided to be part of the case were determined Andy be held accountable. One after the other, several gave crushing statements at his sentencing hearing last year. ""You didn't just betray my friendship, but you shattered the sense of safety I used to take for granted,"" Jess told the court. ""The world feels unfamiliar and dangerous, I am constantly anxious, I have nightmares when I am able to sleep. ""Forming new friendships feels impossible, burdened by the constant question: 'Could this person be like you?'"" When it came time for Andy to apologise to the women he'd targeted, Jess and Hannah couldn't stomach being in the room. They walked out. ""There is nothing that he can say to me that makes it better, and I wanted him to know that,"" Hannah says. Andy told the court that creating the images had felt ""empowering"" as ""an outlet"" for a ""dark"" part of his psyche, but that he didn't think they would cause real harm. ""I have really done a terrible thing and I am so very sorry,"" he said. Judge Jane Culver was not convinced of his remorse, saying while there was ""some contrition"", he didn't seem to understand the clearly ""profound and ongoing"" suffering that his ""prolific"" and ""disturbing"" offending had caused. She sentenced Andy to nine years in jail - in what has been called a landmark decision. ""The gasp that went through the court... it was such a relief,"" Jess says. ""It was the first time I felt like we had actually been listened to."" Andy will be eligible for parole in December 2029, but has told the court he intends to challenge his sentence. Nicole Shackleton, a law expert who researches technology and gender, told the BBC the ""unprecedented"" case set a surprising, and significant, legal standard for future cases. The judge had recognised ""this wasn't merely something that happened online"" and that such behaviour was ""tied to offline violence against women"", said Dr Shackleton, from Melbourne's RMIT University. But Australia and other countries remain poor at regulating the use of AI and proactively investigating its misuse, experts like her argue. Australia has recently criminalised the creation and sharing of deepfake pornography at a national level. But many other countries have legislation accused of containing loopholes, or do not criminalise deepfake pornography at all. In the UK, sharing it is an offence, but creating or soliciting it is not - though this is about to change. And in the face of under-trained and under-resourced police forces, many victims like Hannah or private investigators - like the one who tipped her off - are left to be de facto detectives and regulators. In a statement, NSW Police said investigations into AI crimes are a challenging, ""resource and time intensive process"", and training has recently been beefed up ""with the goal that every officer... can respond to these types of crimes effectively"". The force also works with the eSafety Commissioner and tech companies to take down deepfake abuse, the statement added. eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said removal of the distressing material is the top priority for most victim-survivors, and eSafety had ""an extremely high success rate in achieving it"". But eSafety does not have the punitive powers to pursue criminal investigations and penalties, she added in a statement to the BBC. ""You can have whatever laws you like, [but] if you have a police force that are incompetent..."" Kris says, trailing off. ""We're obviously angry at Andy. But it is also disgusting that the only way you get justice with something like this is if you're two people in your 30s that can afford to bully the police."" They're determined for things to be different for future victims. In the past six months alone, two schoolboys in separate cases in NSW and Victoria have been reported to police for allegedly creating mass deepfake nudes of their classmates. After several years of hell, Hannah is also trying to move on. But Andy's looming appeal threatens the hard work she's done to rebuild her life and mental health. Knees at her chest and feet tucked under her on the couch, she says Andy got the sentence he deserved. ""Because for me, and for the other girls, it is forever… they will always be on the internet,"" she says. She still pays for a service which scours the web for the pictures, and she worries about future friends, employers, students - her own children - finding them. One of her biggest fears is that her best memories will never be reclaimed. ""You post things on Facebook and Instagram because they're the happiest moments of your life. You get a dog, you buy a house, you get engaged and you post a photo. ""He had turned every single one of those moments for us into porn. And so when you see that photo… well, now I see myself getting raped.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5d0z8v0z0o,Heavy flooding expected after Cyclone downgraded in Australia,"A tropical storm is expected to make landfall on Australia's eastern coast on Saturday morning as tens of thousands of people have been evacuated and more than 230,000 households left without power. Initially called Cyclone Alfred, the weather front was downgraded to a tropical low with winds set to reach up to 85km/h, less strong than first forecast. The Bureau of Meteorology said the storm is currently sitting off Bribie Island and is moving slowly north, and expected to cross the mainland coast between the island and Maroochydore. Authorities are still warning people to stay indoors, with fines for those who visit beaches, as heavy rain and flooding is still expected. On Saturday morning, senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury from the Bureau of Meteorology, said there is an ongoing risk of widespread severe weather, especially rainfall. ""Our 24-hour rainfall totals could easily exceed 200mm or more over the next couple of days as that system slows and moves inland,"" she told ABC News Breakfast. ""The rain is still coming through in full force, and we're still seeing widespread flash-flooding, widespread impacts, likely to continue through today and well into tomorrow as well,"" she added. The ex-tropical cyclone has already caused flooding which authorities fear could worsen over the weekend. New South Wales police said on Friday that one man was missing after his vehicle was swept into a fast-flowing river. Four million people across Queensland and northern New South Wales are in the firing line of the storm. But its slow progress, described by weather experts as ""walking pace"" and ""erratic"", has raised concerns of flash and riverine flooding in low-lying areas. Stephen Valentine and his wife, who live in Logan city south of Brisbane, have prepared some 30 litres of water, food for themselves and their pets, and set up ""protected rooms"" in their home situated away from windows. ""At the moment we are as prepared as we can be for something that none of us have been through... Nothing has come this far south across the south,"" said Mr Valentine, who grew up in the city. ""We would get the edge of a cyclone ever so often, but not to this level,"" he added.  While Queensland isn't a stranger to cyclones – it's the most disaster-prone state in Australia – it's rare they come so far south. ""These are tough times, but Australians are tough people, and we are resilient people,"" said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday, echoing the Gold Coast's acting Mayor Donna Gates, who has said Cyclone Alfred is a ""scary proposition"" for the region. Nearly 1,000 schools have closed, public transport has been suspended and airports are shut. Flights aren't expected to resume until Sunday at the earliest. Elective surgeries have also been cancelled. The last time a cyclone hit was in 1974, when Wanda hit in January and then two months later, Zoe crossed the coast. Flooding though, is more common. In February 2022, thousands of homes were damaged along much of Australia's east after heavy rain. Authorities have been keen to prepare communities ahead of Cyclone Alfred. The council opened sandbag depots across the region to help residents protect their homes. ""It's surreal. We know it's coming, but it's very quiet,"" said Anthony Singh, a resident of the Brisbane suburb of West End. He waited for four hours on Wednesday to pick up sandbags to protect his home. Fellow resident Mark Clayton, helped to co-ordinate the sandbag collection, shovelling more than 140 tonnes of sand. ""I think people are a bit apprehensive,"" he says. ""Are the buildings going to stay up, are the roofs going to stay on? People expect a lot of trees to come down and to lose power for an extended period of time."" With supermarkets now shut and people mostly sheltering at home, there's a lot of uncertainty as Australians wait for the storm to hit. But some die-hard surfers have thrown caution to the increasing wind. ""This is what we look forward to,"" said surfer Jeff Weatherall as he waited for a jet ski to pick him up from Kirra beach and carry him into the big waves. ""This is the fifth day straight - I've done nothing but eat, sleep, surf and do it again."" Kirra beach is famous for its breakers and surfers have been busy this week seizing the strong winds. ""There are people that are going to lose their houses, but at the moment, you're taking the good of it all. This is just crazy surf,"" said surfer Donnie Neal. Meanwhile Albanese have warned people to take the cyclone warnings seriously. ""This isn't a time for sightseeing or for seeing what it's like to experience these conditions firsthand,"" he said. ""Please stay safe. Be sensible."" Additional reporting by Kelly Ng and Hafsa Khalil",2025-03-07T20:46:30.170Z,Katy Watson
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20d1k1gjjvo,Rower rescued days before completing trans-Pacific feat,"An adventurer who tried to row across the Pacific Ocean from the United States to Australia has been rescued just days before he reached his final destination. Lithuanian rower Aurimas Mockus sounded a distress signal late on Friday after he was stranded by a cyclone, and surrounded by towering waves and strong winds packing up to 100 km/h (62 mph), local media reported. Authorities made radio contact with Mr Mockus the next day when he was about 740km east of Mackay, a city on Australia's east coast in the Coral Sea. By the time he was rescued on Monday morning, the 44-year-old had spent nearly five months alone at sea. Mr Mockus is getting medical treatment on an Australian warship, which will take him to Sydney, the Australian navy said. He was attempting to become one of few rowers who have crossed the Pacific alone and without stopping. Among them are Britons Peter Bird and John Beeden, who achieved the feat in 1983 and 2015 respectively, and Australian Michelle Lee in 2023. Mr Mockus started his 12,000km-long journey in October from San Diego in southern California. Brisbane was meant to be his destination. He rowed for an average of 12 hours a day, according to local reports. He regularly updated his progress on Instagram. In the latest post published a day before he called for help, Mr Mockus reported that he had crossed the Chesterfield Islands, a cluster of French coral islands about 1,500km east of Australia. ""The highlight is that I successfully sailed the reefs of Chesterfield Islands. And further as God allows... The most important thing is to hold back the next few days,"" he wrote. Tropical Cyclone Alfred, which derailed Mr Mockus's plan, is forecast to hit Australia's eastern states of Queensland and New South Wales in the coming days.",2025-03-03T07:24:51.133Z,Kelly Ng
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4xqe60gyo,Australian whose blood saved 2.4 million babies dies,"One of the world's most prolific blood donors - whose plasma saved the lives of more than two million babies - has died. James Harrison died in his sleep at a nursing home in New South Wales, Australia on 17 February, his family said on Monday. He was 88. Known in Australia as the man with the golden arm, Harrison's blood contained a rare antibody, Anti-D, which is used to make medication given to pregnant mothers whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service who paid tribute to Harrison, said he had pledged to become a donor after receiving transfusions while undergoing a major chest surgery when he was 14. He started donating his blood plasma when he was 18 and continued doing so every two weeks until he was 81. In 2005, he had the world record for most blood plasma donated - a title he held until 2022 when he was overtaken by a man in the US. Harrison's daughter, Tracey Mellowship, said her father was ""very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain"". ""He always said it does not hurt, and the life you save could be your own,"" she said. Mellowship and two of Harrison's grandchildren are also recipients of anti-D immunisations. ""It made [James] happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness,"" she said. Anti-D jabs protect unborn babies from a deadly blood disorder called haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn, or HDFN. The condition occurs at pregnancy when the mother's red blood cells are incompatible with that of their growing baby. The mother's immune system then sees the baby's blood cells as a threat and produces antibodies to attack them. This can seriously harm the baby, causing severe anaemia, heart failure, or even death. Before anti-D interventions were developed in the mid-1960s, one in two babies diagnosed with HDFN died. It is unclear how Harrison's blood came to be so rich in anti-D, but some reports said it had to do with the massive blood transfusion he received at 14. There are fewer than 200 anti-D donors in Australia, but they help an estimated 45,000 mothers and their babies every year, according to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, also known as Lifeblood. Lifeblood has been working with Australia's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research to grow anti-D antibodies in the lab by replicating blood and immune cells from Harrison and other donors. Researchers involved hope lab-made anti-D can one day be used to help pregnant women worldwide. ""Creating a new therapy has long been a 'holy grail',"" Lifeblood's research director David Irving said. He noted the scarcity of donors committed to regular donation, who are able to produce antibodies in sufficient quality and quantity.",2025-03-03T03:58:13.451Z,Kelly Ng
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz03l18jv97o,Couple's trauma after body placed next to them on flight,"An Australian couple have spoken of the ""traumatic"" moment the body of a dead passenger was placed next to them on a Qatar Airways flight. Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a dream holiday, told Australia's Channel 9 a woman had died in the aisle beside them during the flight from Melbourne to Doha. The couple say cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him, despite there being empty seats. Qatar Airways said it apologised for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"". The couple said they had not been contacted or offered support by Qatar Airways or Qantas, the airline through which they booked the flight. In a later statement on Wednesday, Qatar Airways said it had now spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns, as well as the family of the woman who died. Mr Ring told Channel Nine's Current Affair programme that staff had responded ""in no time"" when the woman collapsed, but that ""unfortunately the lady couldn't be saved, which was pretty heart-breaking to watch"". He said the cabin crew had tried to move her body towards business class ""but she was quite a large lady and they couldn't get her through the aisle"". Mr Ring said the crew had seen seats were available beside him. ""They said, 'Can you move over please?' and I just said, 'Yes no problem'. ""Then they placed the lady in the chair I was in."" While Ms Colin was able to move to an empty seat nearby, Mr Ring said he had not been given the option to do so by cabin crew - even though there were vacant seats. When the plane landed four hours later, he said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board. He said ambulance officers had then started pulling blankets off the woman and he had seen her face. The couple said there needed to be a ""duty of care"" for customers and staff. ""We should be contacted to make sure, do you need some support, do you need some counselling?"" Ms Colin called the experience ""traumatic"" and said: ""We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board."" In its latest statement, Qatar Airways said: ""We have been in contact with the family of the passenger who passed away to express our condolences on their loss. We have also directly spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns. ""The safety and comfort of all our passengers is of paramount importance to us."" A Qantas spokesperson said: ""The process for handling incidents onboard an aircraft like this is managed by the operating airline, which in this case is Qatar Airways."" Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, said deaths in the air ""occur more frequently than people would think"" but said as a far as he was aware there was no specific protocol in place for such situations. ""On a long haul flight it tends to depend largely on when it occurs and where it occurs and what the crew have in terms of facilities to place the body somewhere because on an aeroplane, there's no access to the hold, there's a crew rest area but that's for the crew so it can be problematical."" A toilet area or galley area could be blocked off, he said, but the crew are required to keep a certain number of toilets available. Mr Eustance said that, while he was not being judgemental as he did not know the full situation, he was surprised that the crew did not move Mr Ring if there had been spare seats. ""I would expect the crew would do all they could to avoid that. You are creating potential future liabilities in terms of the trauma of the people next to whom the body was placed,"" he said. ""In my experience the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons. You have a dead body that is uncontained and all that goes with it.""",2025-02-26T09:48:54.959Z,Maia Davies
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9yxvjx19go,Religious sect parents jailed over death of diabetic daughter,"The parents of an eight-year-old diabetic girl in Australia who died after they denied her insulin for almost a week have each been sentenced to 14 years in jail for manslaughter. Elizabeth Struhs had in 2019 been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Her parents belonged to a religious sect known as The Saints, who opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. She died from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes at her home in Toowoomba west of Brisbane in January 2022. Her father Jason Struhs and mother Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter last month. The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens has been jailed for 13 years by the judge at the Supreme Court of Queensland, who called him a ""dangerous, highly manipulative individual"". Eleven other members were handed jail terms of six to nine years. Stevens and the girl's father had been on trial for murder but they were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty. When handing down his almost 500-page verdict last month, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. ""Due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."" Elizabeth would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness because she was denied medical care, prosecutor Caroline Marco said during the trial, which lasted several months and was heard by a judge sitting alone without a jury. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for the girl as she lay on a mattress and her condition deteriorated. Believing she could be brought back to life, the sect member made no effort to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, the court heard. ""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" her father Jason Struhs had earlier told the court. Stevens, 63, had defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"". He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"". Type 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin. Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs had earlier said she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals. The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and count around two dozen members from three families among its members.",2025-02-26T09:25:29.478Z,Simon Atkinson
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz65p1k45o,"Children routinely using social media, Australian regulator says","More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research. It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year. The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children. The regulator accused the apps of ""a lack of robust interventions"" for checking the ages of their users. The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube. Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions. For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children. In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason. It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force. ""The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps,"" said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant. Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users. In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram - took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. ""This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,"" said a TikTok spokesperson. ""Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision."" A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies. Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms. They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer. Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer. The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13. If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year. ""These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,"" the report's authors said. ""However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account."" The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users. Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service. ""Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,"" the report said. ""This may require time and engagement to detect a child under 13, and in that time the child may be exposed to risks and harms.""",2025-02-20T14:31:30.425Z,Graham Fraser
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rkx37vd6zo,Australian woman charged with assaulting two Muslims,"Australian police have charged a 31-year-old woman for assaulting two Muslim women at a shopping centre in Melbourne last week. The woman from Pascoe Vale suburb is due in court on Wednesday, where it will be alleged that she targeted the two victims on 13 February because of their head coverings, local media report. She allegedly grabbed and choked a 30-year-old pregnant woman using the latter's hijab at Epping shopping centre before pushing and slapping another 26-year-old woman in a separate assault 10 minutes later. This comes two weeks after the country passed tough new laws against hate crimes following a recent string of high-profile antisemitic attacks. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday condemned the incident as ""reprehensible"". He rejected criticism that his government was taking Islamophobic attacks less seriously compared to antisemitic attacks. ""I take all attacks on people on the basis of their faith seriously, and they should all face the full force of the law,"" he told reporters. Melbourne police say they are investigating reports of online threats against one of the two victims in the shopping centre. Both suffered non-life-threatening injuries. On Tuesday, Australia's anti-Islamophobia envoy, Aftab Malik, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that ""all forms of hate need to stop"" and that the country's leaders must condemn the incident in Melbourne. Earlier in the week, the president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Rateb Jneid, expressed alarm over attacks on Muslims in the country and called the government's response ""grossly insufficient"".  Australia's government has described new laws passed in early February as the ""toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes"". It imposes mandatory jail terms ranging from one to six years for the use of hate symbols such as the Nazi salute. The reforms come as attacks on Jewish targets have become a topic of fierce debate in the country. Last week, two Australian nurses were suspended after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them. In late January, Sydney police found a caravan containing explosives and an antisemitic note. A week before that, set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages",2025-02-19T08:12:23.359Z,Joel Guinto
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7e38py4geo,Scores of whales to be euthanised after mass stranding in Australia,"Australian authorities are euthanising about 90 false killer whales which survived a mass stranding on a remote beach in Tasmania. A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them. They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding. Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years. False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes. Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress. Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight. ""There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'."" ""It's just absolutely horrific."" The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media. ""This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,"" he said. ""We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else."" Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful. ""The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,"" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service. With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the ""tough"" and ""confronting"" decision to euthanise the remaining whales. ""The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,"" Dr Carlyon said. That grim task - which involves shooting the animals - is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday. Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested ""it may be a case of... letting nature run its course"". Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access. More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast. Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022. Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication. There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore. Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17ejwnywyno,Australian nurses suspended over 'vile' antisemitic video,"Two Australian nurses have been suspended after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them. The man and woman - both employees at a Sydney hospital - are now being investigated by police, officials in New South Wales (NSW) said. State Health Minister Ryan Park said that a ""thorough investigation"" would be carried out to make sure there had been ""no adverse [patient] outcomes"", but that a ""rapid"" examination of hospital records had not turned up anything unusual. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the video as ""sickening and shameful"" after it began circulating online. It comes less than a week after Australia passed tougher laws against hate crimes following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks. On Wednesday, NSW Police said that they believed they had ""identified the individuals involved"" in the video. The health minister said both had been stood down immediately, and promised that they would never work in the NSW healthcare system again. The video was shared on TikTok by content creator Max Veifer, who says he is from Israel. His account features conversations with people he encounters on the app Chatruletka - an anonymous online platform which pairs people randomly for a video chat. The footage, seen by the BBC, appears to have been recorded in a hospital. A man, who claims to be a doctor, tells Mr Veifer that he ""has beautiful eyes"" but adds ""I'm sorry you're Israeli"" before saying he sends Israelis to Jahannam - an Islamic place akin to hell. He goes on to make a throat-slitting gesture, before a woman comes on screen and says that ""one day"" Mr Veifer's ""time will come"" and that he will die, later adding that she won't treat Israelis. ""I won't treat them, I will kill them,"" she says. The video has been edited, emojis have been added, and some comments have been bleeped out - but authorities are not questioning its authenticity. Albanese described it as ""disgusting"" and ""vile"", writing on X: ""These antisemitic comments, driven by hate, have no place in our health system and no place anywhere in Australia. ""Individuals found to have committed criminal antisemitic acts will face the full force of our laws."" Park also apologised to the Jewish community, and said he wanted to reassure them that they could still expect ""first class"" health care in NSW. ""There is no place in our hospital and health system for this sort of view to ever, ever take place. There is no place for this sort of perspective in our society."" He added that staff at the hospital in the suburb of Bankstown were embarrassed and ashamed, but said it did not diminish the good work they did. In recent months, in incidents unconnected to the hospital video, there have been a series of arson and graffiti attacks involving homes, cars, and synagogues in Jewish areas across Australia, causing fear in the community. A caravan packed with power gel explosives that police warned had the potential to cause a ""mass casualty event"" was found in NSW in January, alongside a document with antisemitic sentiments and a list of Jewish targets in Sydney. The co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said the video served as a ""warning sign once again to all Australians about the evil that exists in our midst"".",2025-02-12T06:00:07.991Z,Simon Atkinson
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmypx0wldro,More than 100 venomous snakes found in Sydney yard,"Australian reptile handlers say they have been stunned to rescue 102 venomous snakes from a backyard mulch pile in Sydney. Cory Kerewaro said his business was initially called to rescue ""a bunch"" of the reptiles after one was reported to have bitten a dog at the property. When his colleague arrived, he discovered 40 red-bellied black snakes - four of which gave birth to more live young once he had placed them in a removal bag. Red-bellied black snakes are one of the most common venomous species in Australia but have not caused any human deaths on record. The five adult and 97 baby snakes are currently under quarantine and will be released into a national park once the weather cools. Mr Kerewaro said it was as record haul for the snake handlers, who normally catch between five and 15 reptiles per day. He said he recalls colleague Dylan Cooper calling him within 15 minutes to say: ""Mate, I'm going to be here a while. It's a pretty big pile... I'm already over 15 snakes!"" ""I thought he was stitching me up."" The dog was ""alive and well"" after the incident which happened on Boxing Day, he added. Female red-bellied black snakes often gather in small groups when they are ready to give birth, possibly to protect against predators, according to Mr Kerewaro. They are the only snake of their genus to give live birth, the Australian Museum says on its website. The species is considered to be shy, and bites - though uncommon - can cause swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. Snake catchers are required by law to release the animals close to where they were found. But given the size this discovery, the catchers have been given permission to release the snakes into a national park away from human interactions.",2025-02-07T07:59:01.918Z,Iris Zeng
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8x98z0kvlo,Mandatory jail for Nazi salutes under new Australia laws,"Hate symbols and terror offences will be punishable with mandatory jail terms ranging from one to six years in Australia, after parliament passed a series of amendments to hate crime laws on Thursday. The new laws were passed following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks which have become a major topic of debate in the country. The amendments have been described by the government as the ""toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes"". But critics say that the governing Labor Party is caving to opposition demands and going against its own policy of opposing mandatory jail sentences. Under the amendments, displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute is now punishable with at least one year in prison. Other penalties include a minimum of three years for financing terrorism and six years for committing or planning terrorist acts. There have been several attacks on Jewish targets in Australia in recent months. Last week authorities in Sydney found a caravan containing explosives and an antisemitic note. The discovery came just a week after a childcare centre near a Jewish school and synagogue in Sydney was set on fire and antisemitic graffiti was seen on one of its walls. In December, a synagogue in Melbourne was set alight with worshippers inside. No-one was seriously hurt in the incident, which sent shockwaves through the country. Former Labor senator Kim Carr criticised the party for what he said was a ""clear breach of the Labor party national platform"". Labor opposes mandatory sentences on the grounds that such penalties do not reduce crime, undermine the courts' independence and are often discriminatory in practice. But opposition parties did not rush to welcome the new amendments either, accusing Labor of dragging its feet. ""The parliament is not acting today because of the decisiveness of the Labor Party,"" Liberal senator James Paterson told reporters in Canberra. ""The prime minister has been dragged kicking and screaming to finally introduce tough legislation that will ensure there are real penalties for this behaviour."" Performing the Nazi salute and displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika, have been banned since January 2024 and carry up to one year in jail. The amendments on Thursday make the jail term mandatory. ""This is not about politics,"" Home Affairs minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday night as the amendments were introduced to parliament. ""This is about whether the Australian Parliament believes it's acceptable to advocate, threaten or commit violence against another person because of who they are, who they pray to or who they love.""",2025-02-06T08:19:13.171Z,Koh Ewe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9l1w5zlgdo,Scientists produce first kangaroo embryo using IVF,"Australian scientists have produced the world's first kangaroo embryo through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a breakthrough they say could help save other species from extinction. Using specimens from eastern grey kangaroos, the researchers successfully injected a single sperm cell into an egg, but said achieving a live birth would require more work and ""technical advancements"". The feat provides important insights into marsupial breeding and could aid efforts to improve the genetic diversity of endangered species such as the koala, Tasmanian devil, northern hairy-nosed wombat and Leadbeater's possum, lead researcher Andres Gambini said. Australia houses the largest variety of marsupial mammals, but it also has the highest rate of mammal extinctions. The University of Queensland experiment looked at the growth of kangaroo eggs and sperm in a laboratory setting before creating embryos using a method known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The technique, which is already used on humans and some domestic animals, was tried on eastern grey kangaroos that had died. The species was selected because it is not endangered and has existing high populations. Despite how iconic marsupial species are in Australia and the crucial role they play in its biodiversity, studies into their tissues have been limited, scientists say. ""We are now refining techniques to collect, culture and preserve marsupial eggs and sperm,"" said Dr Gambini, adding that such methods would play a crucial role in safeguarding ""the genetic material of these unique and precious animals"". IVF is being used as a tool to try and preserve endangered species the world over. Last year, scientists achieved the world's first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother in Kenya. In 2018, IVF was also used to create the world's first donkey embryo.",2025-02-06T03:10:04.346Z,Hannah Ritchie
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpvrgezp3o,Second woman confirmed dead in Australia's floods,"A second woman is confirmed to have died in flooding which has inflicted ""incredible"" devastation on communities in northern Australia. Police said the 82-year-old woman's body was found in a cane paddock in Queensland on Tuesday, two days after a 63-year-old woman died when a dinghy she was in overturned during a rescue attempt. The region has been inundated since Saturday, with parts of northern Queensland seeing nearly 2m (6.5 ft) of rain. By Tuesday, conditions were starting to ease - although Queensland Premier David Crisafulli warned it was still ""a disaster that's going to test the resolve of people"" during an interview with broadcaster ABC. He described the devastation as ""incredible"", but noted weather conditions had been ""really kind"" in recent hours. Thousands had begun to return to their homes. In Townsville, locals woke on Tuesday to grey skies and drizzle, and the news that predicted flooding levels had not materialised there. It was a stark contrast to the intense downpours which have battered the region over the past few days. ""We believe that the danger has passed,"" Townsville Local Disaster Management Group chair Andrew Robinson told reporters. Pointing to earlier forecasts which had suggested up to 2,000 Townsville homes could have faced flood risks, Crisafulli said that ""the city had dodged a bullet"". Local resident Jo Berry told the BBC she and her family were among those returning home on Tuesday, after spending a sleepless night monitoring the rainfall. ""People talk about PTSD when it rains here and I totally understand,"" says Ms Berry, formerly from Leicester in the UK. ""We've been in the house here for over 20 years, and have been through a few cyclone events and the 2019 flooding so it is not our first rodeo,"" she adds, referring to a flooding disaster which caused A$1.24bn (£620m; $770m) in damage. On Monday night, other local residents told the BBC they were ""on a knife edge"" as they waited to see whether their houses would survive. But further north in the state, power outages and damaged roads have made it difficult to assess the full extent of the destruction in towns such as Ingham and Cardwell. Crisafulli said early reports suggested the damage was ""quite frankly incredible"" and that Ingham, which is almost entirely without electricity, ""remains the biggest challenge"". ""There are people who have been inundated at home, in their businesses and in their farms,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. Footage published in local media showed long lines at the town's supermarket as people waited for critical supplies. Crisafulli said that amid the blackout the local hospital was operating as normal, and a petrol station was open. The flooding has caused damage to the area's homes, crops and coastline, local MP Nick Dametto said in a video posted online. ""The inundation is something that I have never seen before,"" he said. Home to fewer than 5,000 people, Ingham was already reeling after the 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday. The second woman's body was found on Tuesday just north of Ingham after a neighbour raised the alarm. She was last seen on Monday night in a house, Queensland Police said in a statement. More than 8,000 properties remain without power across northern Queensland, according to the state's energy provider, and the partial collapse of a critical highway continues to hinder efforts to assist some of the hardest-hit areas. Crisafulli said the recovery effort would ""take some time"" and that the priority in the coming hours would be to work with the army to get power generators to isolated communities and ""bring them back online"". He added that federal funding would help reconstruct the battered Bruce Highway - the state's main thoroughfare which stretches 1,673km (1,039 miles) from the south. Located in the tropics, northern Queensland is vulnerable to destructive cyclones, storms, and flooding. Speaking to the BBC in Townsville, Scott Heron, a local resident and climate expert, said the latest disaster was not unexpected. ""For a long time, climate scientists have been clear that extreme weather events will become more extreme, and we are seeing that,"" said Prof Heron , who works at James Cook University and is the Unesco Chair on Climate Vulnerability of Heritage. Prof Heron urged politicians to consider this as they planned recovery and rebuilding efforts, such as to the Bruce Highway. It would be ""wasting public money"" if infrastructure planning, particularly for long-term projects including roads and bridges, did not ""incorporate changing threats due to climate change"", he said.

Authorities have urged people living in those spots to leave. They were given a deadline of noon on Sunday, but like plenty of others, Mr Duric has opted to stay put. ""We've only been here 12 months, so I've relied on a lot of information from people around us,"" he says. ""We were thinking about moving out, but we have pets, we've got nowhere to go so have decided to follow the neighbour's advice and stay. ""We haven't panicked but we are prepared. Let's hope for the best and hope we don't have to use the sand bags."" The city has been inundated with more than 600mm (23.6in) of rain in the past week. Other parts of the state of Queensland have seen almost 1.3m of rain since Saturday, causing rivers and reservoirs to overflow, with officials suggesting as many as 2,000 homes could be inundated before the water reached its peak. But by late Monday afternoon, both the cloud and the mood had lifted. The first break in the rain for days bringing smiles, and curiosity, as locals headed out to inspect the waterways. For Daniel Watts, walking the dog with his family, there's a glimmer of optimism that their home will not suffer the same fate as during floods here six years ago – when water rose 1.5 metres and his property had to be gutted. ""It's been on a knife edge as to whether our house will get inundated or not, so there's been quite a bit of anxiety,"" he told the BBC. ""Luckily, it hasn't yet. And at this stage, the dam levels are retreating, which is good. It's still wait and see, though. It wouldn't take much."" The Townsville Disaster Management Group expects the Ross River to peak between 07:00 and 08:00 on Tuesday (21:00 to 22:00GMT). ""We're not quite out of the woods yet,"" Queensland state Premier David Crisafulli told ABC News. But Mr Watts is taking comfort from Monday's easing weather – a contrast to 2019 when, he says, the rain ""just did not stop"". ""Having a bit of a reprieve is from the rain is really good,"" he said. ""It gives everything just time. It gives time for the river and the dam, but we'll see.

The flooding has claimed a woman's life and caused havoc across the state's north, with residents in Townsville, Ingham, and Cardwell among the hardest hit. ""Record"" downpours are set to continue, authorities say, with parts of the region already experiencing almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday, causing rivers and reservoirs to overflow. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese - who was briefed about the response efforts on Monday - said that the disaster had brought out ""the best of Australians"". ""I've seen Australians helping one another in their time of need,"" he wrote on X, adding that the ""threat from floodwaters"" would persist in affected areas for days. Efforts to assist the hardest-hit areas have been hindered by flood damage to parts of the Bruce Highway - the main thoroughfare stretching 1,673km (1039 miles) from the state's south. This included the partial collapse of a bridge that could add an extra 700km to driving routes and slow down the delivery of critical supplies, the Queensland Trucking Association told the ABC. Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli offered his condolences to the ""tight-knit"" town of Ingham, after a 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday. ""We are deeply sorry for their loss,"" he told reporters on Monday. Crisafulli also urged all residents located in the so-called ""black-zone"" of the floods - which includes six Townsville suburbs - to not return home, due to the ongoing threat posed by the nearby Ross River. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said the area had received six months of rainfall in three days. About 2,000 homes could be inundated as water levels rise before their expected peak on Tuesday, the Townsville Local Disaster Management Group warned. Many homes have already been flooded. One Ingham resident who lives with her elderly mother told the Townsville Bulletin that she had waited seven hours for emergency services to help them evacuate after their property was affected. ""I was crying, I was hysterical. Someone even hung up on me when I called [emergency number] triple-0, saying: 'We're busy,'"" she said. Though rainfall is now easing, major flood warnings remain in place for communities along several rivers. Crisafulli has warned that Ingham could be on track to experience its worst flooding in 60 years if the Herbert river surpasses a peak of 15.2m. Emergency responders have continued working around the clock, with the SES receiving 480 calls for help on Sunday night and performing 11 ""swift water"" rescues. Widespread power outages continue to be reported, making it impossible for some communities to call for assistance. SES Deputy Commissioner Shane Chelepy urged people to stay vigilant and check on their neighbours when possible. He added that some 400 people were now being housed in evacuation centres across Townsville, Ingham, and Cardwell. Authorities have also asked locals to be on the lookout for crocodiles, saying that they could be lurking in streams away from their usual habitats.

Authorities say waters will continue to rise and have warned of a ""dangerous and life-threatening"" situation, with parts of the region recording almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday. ""Record"" downpours are set to continue into Monday, according to Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli. Meteorologists say these could be the worst floods in the region in more than 60 years. Crisafulli said conditions were unlike anything northern Queensland had experienced ""for a long time"". ""It's not just the intensity, but it's also the longevity of it,"" he told Australian broadcaster ABC. The woman who died was onboard a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy which hit a tree and capsized in the town of Ingham. It is understood she was a member of the public who was being rescued at the time, and was not an emergency worker. The other five people on board were able to get to safety. An investigation has been launched. Meanwhile, three people were rescued from the roof of a house in Cardwell, about halfway between Cairns and Townsville. Video has emerged showing a man clinging to a pole in Ingham after his vehicle was washed away - and being taken to safety by locals in a boat. The Townsville Local Disaster Management Group says that 2,000 homes in the city may be inundated - some up to the second floor - as river levels rise. Thousands of people across six Townsville suburbs were told to leave their homes by midday on Sunday, but officials say about 10% of residents had opted to stay. The same areas were severely hit during 2019 flooding. Premier Crisafulli urged people to heed the warnings, saying: ""In the end, houses and cars and furniture, that can all be replaced. Your family can't"". On Sunday night local time a new evacuation centre was being opened - as others reached capacity. Parts of the road on a major highway collapsed, hampering efforts to get rescue teams and sandbags to the worst-hit areas. Meanwhile supermarkets had run out of fresh food, and thousands of homes were without power, including in Ingham and the Indigenous community of Palm Island.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn1dd6g1po,Australian police find explosives for possible antisemitic attack,"Authorities in Sydney are investigating whether explosives discovered in a caravan were intended for an antisemitic attack. The explosives could have caused a 40m-wide blast and ""significant damage,"" police said on Wednesday, adding that the threat was contained. A note was found in the caravan that displayed antisemitic messages, investigators said. ""This is the discovery of a potential mass casualty event,"" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said.  New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner David Hudson told a news conference that the caravan was discovered on 19 January in Dural, a suburb of north-west Sydney. The investigation became public on Wednesday after details of it were leaked to the media. There was ""some indication that the explosives might be used in some form of antisemitic attack,"" Mr Hudson said, but he wouldn't be drawn on the possible target. He said officers had ""mitigated the risk as much as possible"" but stressed: ""I'm not saying it's been eliminated. I'm saying it's been mitigated."" ""That's one of the reasons we're talking today, for members of the public to be vigilant in relation to what they see and what they hear in relation to antisemitism in our community.""

He said he agreed with Premier Chris Minns in describing it as ""terrorism"". It has not yet been designated as terrorism by NSW Police. Earlier, Albanese said that New South Wales Police had ""people in custody"" and was working with the AFP taskforce investigating antisemitic crimes called Special Operation Avalite. Minns said the threat would be ""met with the full resources of the government"". The discovery follows a spate of antisemitic attacks in Australia in recent months. On Thursday, police said a Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs had been vandalised with antisemitic graffiti. In December, worshippers were forced to flee as Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue was set on fire. Earlier this month, a childcare centre in Sydney was set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages. Additional reporting by Iris Zeng in Sydney",2025-01-30T00:11:18.961Z,Maia Davies
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74mjxmg10zo,Australian sect members guilty of causing girl's death,"Fourteen members of an Australian religious group have been convicted of killing an eight-year-old diabetic girl who was denied insulin for almost a week. Elizabeth Struhs died at home in 2022 from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes. The court heard that Elizabeth's treatment was withheld because the group, known as the Saints, opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. Her father Jason Struhs and the group's leader Brendan Stevens were on trial for murder but convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Twelve other members, including Elizabeth's mother and brother, were also convicted of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty. When handing down his almost 500-page verdict on Wednesday, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. ""It cannot be doubted that Elizabeth was lovingly cared for in almost every way,"" he said. ""However, due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."" The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and have roughly two dozen members from three families. The judge-alone trial in the Supreme Court of Queensland began in July last year and lasted several months. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days. ""She was described as speaking little, needing help going to the toilet, and being incontinent,"" prosecutor Caroline Marco said, adding that the girl would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for Elizabeth, whose health deteriorated as she lay on a mattress at her home in Toowoomba, about 125km (78 miles) west of Brisbane. No effort was made to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, as the group believed she could be brought back to life, the court heard. The 14 defendants, aged between 22 and 67, represented themselves at trial, having all refused legal representation or to enter pleas. The court was required to enter not guilty pleas on their behalf. Most had been charged because they had either counselled or aided her father in his decision to withhold Elizabeth's insulin, the court heard. Prosecutors said that Jason Struhs, 53, had converted to the church much later than his wife Kerrie Struhs, 49, and that he had previously supported giving Elizabeth medicine. They argued he changed his mind after being baptised into the group and that ultimately he knew the decision would end his daughter's life. Speaking through tears when it was his turn to take the stand at trial, Jason Struhs said that he and Elizabeth had agreed to ""stop the insulin"" together, and that he still believed his daughter would be resurrected. ""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" he told the court. Stevens, 63, defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"". He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"" and that their decision not to enter pleas was because the congregation had ""no intention of fighting"" the case by using law. Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs told the trial she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having increasingly strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals. The court also heard that Elizabeth's life had been in danger in 2019 when she was admitted to hospital in a diabetic coma weighing just 15kg (2st 5lb), after having become too weak to walk. She was then diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Both parents were charged over that incident - however Jason Struhs testified against his wife and received a more lenient sentence. At the time, he said his wife - who had been a member of the Saints for years - did not believe in providing their kids with medical treatment for religious reasons. He also openly expressed regret for having ""let his daughter down"". The court heard he later helped provide her with insulin for a period while his wife was in jail, but that he then faced pressure from other members of the religious group to stop doing so. Giving his verdict, Justice Burns said that Jason Struhs and Stevens couldn't be convicted of murder because prosecutors had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the pair had intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Elizabeth. But all 14 defendants were guilty of manslaughter, he ruled, because they were jointly involved in a crime that resulted in her death. Jayde Struhs said that while she was pleased with the verdict, the ""system had failed"" her sister. ""We are only here today because more wasn't done sooner to protect her or remove her from an incredibly unsafe situation in her own home,"" she said in a statement outside court. The group is expected to be sentenced next month. Toowoomba has long had a ""colourful array of sectarian Christian groups and independent churches of various kinds"", says Bernard Doherty, who studies new religious movements. ""The Saints appear to be one of these small independent churches which form around a few families,"" he told the BBC, adding that little is known about the close-knit congregation. Jayde Struhs said the Saints had attended the Revival Centres International church in Brisbane, but they broke away after Stevens failed to become a pastor there. They then formed their own parish and held sermons at his house multiple times a week, she said.",2025-01-29T05:57:03.147Z,Hannah Ritchie
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70qxq49ejlo,Captain Cook statue vandalised ahead of Australia Day,"Australian police are investigating after a statue of Captain James Cook was covered in red paint and disfigured, ahead of the Australia Day weekend. It is the second time in 12 months that the statue in Sydney has been vandalised. Australia Day is a national holiday that is held each year on 26 January - the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet landing at Sydney Cove in 1788. Many Indigenous Australians say the date causes them pain. The local council in Randwick - the suburb where the statue is located - described the vandalism as ""a disservice to the community and a disservice to reconciliation"". Councillor Carolyn Martin told Sydney radio station 2GB that the vandals had knocked off one hand and parts of the face and nose. The statue - which was first unveiled in 1874 - was previously targeted in February last year, when it was covered with red paint and had parts of its sandstone damaged. Works to repair and restore it were completed a month later. There are several Captain Cook statues across Australia, and others have also been vandalised on or around 26 January. In 2024, one in Melbourne was cut down on the eve of the holiday, while its plinth was spray-painted with the words ""the colony will fall"". Two years earlier the same statue had been splashed with red paint, while in 2018 it was graffitied with the words ""no pride"" and had an Aboriginal flag placed next to it. Cook charted Australia's east coast in 1770, laying the groundwork for the later decision to send the First Fleet, which was led by Captain Arthur Phillip. Australia Day is a contentious holiday for some, particularly among those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who view it as a reminder of the dispossession and displacement of their people. To many Australians though, it is celebrated as a day of nation-building and achievement. Polling suggests a majority of people are supportive of keeping the holiday, despite suggestions it should be changed to a different date.",2025-01-24T03:33:04.820Z,Hannah Ritchie
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8057j0mz5mo,"Antisemitic crimes may be funded overseas, say Australian police","Australia's federal police have said they are investigating whether ""overseas actors or individuals"" are paying local criminals to carry out antisemitic crimes in the country. There has been a spate of such incidents in recent months, the latest of which saw a childcare centre in Sydney set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti. No-one was injured. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called a snap cabinet meeting in response, where officials agreed to set up a national database to track antisemitic incidents. Thus far, the federal police taskforce, set up in December to investigate such incidents, received more than 166 reports of antisemitic crimes. Albanese said it appeared some of the crimes were ""being perpetrated by people who don't have a particular issue, aren't motivated by an ideology, but are paid actors"". ""Now, it's unclear who or where the payments are coming from,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said it was possible that cryptocurrencies - which can take longer to identify - had been used. He added that police were also investigating whether young people were carrying out these crimes and whether they had been radicalised online. However, Mr Kershaw cautioned, ""intelligence is not the same as evidence"" and more charges were expected soon. Last week, a man from Sydney became the first person to be charged by the federal taskforce, dubbed Special Operation Avalite, over alleged death threats he made towards a Jewish organisation. Albanese said Tuesday's incident at a childcare centre in the eastern Sydney suburb of Maroubra was ""as cowardly as it is disgusting"" and described it as a ""hate crime"". ""This was an attack targeted at the Jewish community. And it is a crime that concerns us all because it is also an attack on the nation and society we have built together,"" he wrote on social media. Israel's deputy foreign minister told the ABC that Australia's government had been ""inflaming"" problems in the local community by not clamping down harder on antisemitic crimes. But Albanese on Wednesday said his government had ""acted from day one"" to protect Australia's Jewish community, and criticised those seeking to make it a ""political issue"". The Jewish Council of Australia, which was set up last year in opposition to antisemitism, said that it ""strongly condemns"" this and all such incidents. ""These acts underscore the urgent need for cooperation, education and community dialogue to combat prejudice and promote understanding,"" it said in a statement. Most of the recent incidents have taken place in Sydney and have involved antisemitic graffiti, arson and vandalism of buildings including synagogues. New South Wales has set up its own state-level taskforce to address these incidents and more than 35 people have been charged so far with antisemitism-related offences. These include a 33-year-old man who was charged on Wednesday over an attempt to set fire to a synagogue earlier this month. A further 70 arrests have been made for similar crimes in the neighbouring state of Victoria, where a synagogue was set on fire last month.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpql7wdz5vyo,Mystery balls on Sydney beaches found to contain faecal bacteria,"The mysterious balls that forced the closure of several beaches in Sydney last week were found to contain saturated fatty acids, E. coli and faecal bacteria, authorities say. Sydney's Northern Beaches council said it has sent the debris to the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) for further analysis. Nine beaches, including popular spots Manly and Dee Why, were closed on 14 January after the marble-sized balls started washing up. It came months after thousands of black blobs started appearing on the city's coasts in October, prompting authorities to close some of its most famous beaches for several days and order a massive clean-up. The latest batch of balls was cleaned up from harbour beaches this week, the Northern Beaches council said in its statement on Tuesday. It urged anyone who spotted the balls not to handle them and to contact authorities. Besides the acids and bacteria, the balls also contained volcanic rock pumice. Northern Beaches mayor Sue Heins said she hopes the EPA analysis will ""identify the source so that they can stop this from happening at other beaches"". ""We are continuing to conduct regular inspections of our beaches and encourage the community to report any sightings,"" she said. The first batch of debris in October were at first mistakenly called ""tar balls"" but were later found to contain everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs. Scientists said they resembled fat, oil and grease blobs - often called ""fatbergs"" - which are commonly formed in sewage systems. But Sydney Water has reported that its water treatment plants are operating normally and that there were no known issues with waste systems in the city.",2025-01-21T06:52:33.378Z,Kelly Ng

The Queensland woman claimed she was chronicling her child's battle with a terminal illness on social media, but detectives allege she was drugging the one-year-old and then filming her in ""immense distress and pain"". Doctors had raised the alarm in October, when the baby was admitted to hospital suffering a serious medical episode. After months of investigation, the 34-year-old woman was charged with torture, administering poison, making child exploitation material and fraud. ""[There are] no words for how repulsive offences of this nature are,"" Queensland Police Det Insp Paul Dalton told reporters on Thursday. Between August and October, detectives say that the woman - from the Sunshine Coast region - gave the child several prescription and pharmacy medicines, without approval. She went to great lengths to obtain the unauthorised medications and cover up her behaviour, they alleged, including using leftover medicine for a different person in their house. Police began investigating on 15 October, when the baby was brought into hospital experiencing ""severe emotional and physical distress and harm"". Tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result later in January, they said. However, Insp Dalton said the child was now ""safe and doing well"". The woman raised A$60,000 (£30,500; $37,300) through GoFundMe donations - which the site is attempting to repay, Det Insp Dalton said. Police had investigated other people over the alleged abuse, but there was no evidence to charge anyone else, he added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvqjrlj8d6o,Marble-sized balls force Sydney beaches to close,"Months after mysterious black balls forced the closure of some of Sydney's most famous beaches, small marble-like debris has begun washing up on the city's shores again. The balls - this time grey or white in colour - have prompted councils to shut nine beaches, including popular Manly and Dee Why, while authorities investigate. Eight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days in October and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of black deposits started appearing on the coast. Testing by authorities determined those balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill. Northern Beaches mayor Sue Heins said the latest balls ""could be anything"", according to the Guardian Australia. ""We don't know at the moment what it is and that makes it even more concerning,"" she said. ""There's something that's obviously leaking or dropping... floating out there and being tossed around."" In a post on Facebook on Tuesday, the Northern Beaches Council said they were alerted to the fresh debris by the New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The agency and the council planned to collect the discoveries for testing and inspect other beaches in the area too. Anyone who spotted the balls was urged to contact authorities, the council added. Though widely reported to be ""tar balls"", the debris in October was later found to contain everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs. Scientists said they resembled fat, oil, and grease blobs - often called fatbergs - which are commonly formed in sewerage systems. However Sydney Water reported there were no known issues with waste systems in the city, and authorities still don't know the source of the material, prompting some to express concerns about the safety of the city's beaches.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vpx5x6wdvo,Bride's fury after Instagram stunt wedding turns out to be real,"A woman in Australia has annulled her marriage after realising that a fake wedding ceremony she took part in for a social media stunt was in fact real. The unknowing bride said her partner was a social media influencer who convinced her to take part in the ceremony as a ""prank"" for his Instagram account. She only discovered the marriage was genuine when he tried to use it to gain permanent residency in Australia. A Melbourne judge granted the annulment after accepting the woman was tricked into getting married, in a judgement published on Thursday. The bizarre case began in September 2023 when the woman met her partner on an online dating platform. They began seeing each other regularly in Melbourne, where they lived at the time. In December that year, the man proposed to the woman and she accepted. Two days later, the woman attended an event with the man in Sydney. She was told it would be a ""white party"" - where attendees would wear white-coloured clothing - and was told to pack a white dress. But when they arrived she was ""shocked"" and ""furious"" to find no other guests present except for her partner, a photographer, the photographer's friend and a celebrant, according to her deposition quoted in court documents. ""So when I got there, and I didn't see anybody in white, I asked him, 'What's happening?'. And he pulled me aside, and he told me that he's organising a prank wedding for his social media, to be precise, Instagram, because he wants to boost his content, and wants to start monetising his Instagram page,"" she said. She said she had accepted his explanation as ""he was a social media person"" who had more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. She also believed that a civil marriage would be valid only if it were held in a court. Still, she remained concerned. The woman rang a friend and voiced her worries, but the friend ""laughed it off"" and said it would be fine because, if it were real, they would have had to file a notice of intended marriage first, which they had not. Reassured, the woman went through the ceremony where she and her partner exchanged wedding vows and kissed in front of a camera. She said she was happy at that time to ""play along"" to ""make it look real"". Two months later, her partner asked her to add him as a dependant in her application for permanent residency in Australia. Both of them are foreigners. When she told him she could not as they were technically not married, he then revealed that their Sydney wedding ceremony had been genuine, according to the woman's testimony. The woman later found their marriage certificate, and discovered a notice of intended marriage which had been filed the month before their Sydney trip - before they even got engaged - which she said she did not sign. According to the court documents, the signature on the notice bears little resemblance to the woman's. ""I'm furious with the fact that I didn't know that that was a real marriage, and the fact that he also lied from the beginning, and the fact that he also wanted me to add him in my application,"" she said. In his deposition, the man claimed they had ""both agreed to these circumstances"" and that following his proposal the woman had agreed to marry him at an ""intimate ceremony"" in Sydney. The judge ruled that the woman was ""mistaken about the nature of the ceremony performed"" and ""did not provide real consent to her participation"" in the marriage. ""She believed she was acting. She called the event 'a prank'. It made perfect sense for her to adopt the persona of a bride in all things at the impugned ceremony so as to enhance the credibility of the video depicting a legally valid marriage,"" he stated in the judgement. The marriage was annulled in October 2024.",2025-01-10T12:33:11.858Z,Tessa Wong
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v14vxdjeo,To conserve or cull? Life in Australia's crocodile capital,"It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap. Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent – that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap. ""You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,"" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile. We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world. The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands. And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs. Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago. After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000. But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast. They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened. The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside. ""The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],"" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb. ""And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem."" The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant. There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia. While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive. Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen. Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018. This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues. Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move. His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin. The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers. The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour. ""It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,"" says Ewin, who's been doing his ""dream job"" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman. ""Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people."" Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education. The NT government goes into schools with its programme ""Be Crocwise"" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats. It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions. ""We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?"" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT. ""If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do."" In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species. Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200. This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans. Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people. In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT. Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs. It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT. Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates. The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT – for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather. Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch ""croc jumping"" - which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience. ""I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,"" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat. ""The bit I don't have to tell you… [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here."" For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them. ""It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,"" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region. Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver. It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT. Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; £398,000) - have all invested in the industry. ""The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,"" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands. His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres. Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry. One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry. For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods. ""My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,"" the Balngarra man says. ""Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles."" But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation. The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity. Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity. Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved. But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined. ""If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,"" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly. ""The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,"" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs. He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay. ""We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator…and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them. ""You try and get people in Sydney or London or New York to put up with a serious predator - they aren't going to do it."" Additional reporting by Simon Atkinson.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdnkdg1l8do,Chlamydia could make koalas extinct. Can a vaccine save them in time?,"On the table, unconscious and stretched out on a pillow, Joe Mangy looks deceptively peaceful. The koala's watery, red-rimmed eyes are the only sign of the disease at war with his body. Tubes snarl out of a mask covering his face as a vet tech listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is not healing as well as they had hoped. Eight days earlier, Joe Mangy – who is about two years old – was found wandering in the middle of a suburban road. Dazed and confused, eyes nearly glued shut with mucus, he was rushed here, to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary's hospital. Enveloped by rainforest on Queensland's Gold Coast, the park is full of koalas like this. Outside the clinic, in a ""Koala Rehab Centre"" faintly perfumed by eucalyptus leaves, is a three-year-old recovering from a hysterectomy. ""It saved her life… but she can't reproduce,"" the head vet Michael Pyne says. Another male koala stares blankly through narrowed slits. His left tear duct is so inflamed his eyeball is barely visible. This hospital is ground zero of a grim chlamydia epidemic which is killing thousands of koalas and making even more sterile, pushing the national icons to the brink of extinction. But it's also at the core of desperate bid to save them with a vaccine – frustrated efforts which, after over a decade, are still tied up in regulation and running out of both time and money. Even a few decades ago, spotting a koala snuggled in a backyard tree was nothing out of the ordinary. They were plentiful on the country's populous east coast. But in recent times the species has been in dramatic decline – in some places plummeting by 80% in just 10 years. Land clearing and urbanisation are leaving the marsupials hungry and homeless, while natural disasters are drowning or cooking them en masse. ""[But] it's the chlamydia that shot up tremendously - almost exponentially,"" says Dr Pyne, who has run the Currumbin clinic for more than 20 years. ""You get days where you're euthanising heaps of koalas that just come in completely ravaged."" Estimates vary greatly – koalas are famously difficult to count – but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered on most of the eastern seaboard. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. Dr Pyne wistfully recounts ""the early days"" when his hospital only saw a handful of koalas a year. They now see 400. So many come through the door that the team has started giving them two names, a vet nurse says, cradling Joe Mangy as he wakes from the anaesthetic. His last name is a nod to the state of his eyes when he first arrived, she explains. Of the top reasons koalas are brought into wildlife hospitals – vehicle strikes, pet attacks and chlamydia – the bacterial infection is the biggest and deadliest. It results in conjunctivitis for koalas like Joe Mangy, but presents as an infection of the genitals and urinary system for others. Particularly unlucky animals, get both at the same time. At its worst, the ocular form can be so bad koalas are blinded and starve to death, while the urogenital infection produces giant fluid-filled cysts so ""nasty"" everyday bodily functions like passing urine make the animals cry out in pain. ""Their reproductive system falls apart,"" Dr Pyne explains. If caught early enough, treatment is an option, but that in itself is a potentially fatal ""nightmare"" as the antibiotics destroy the gut bacteria which allow koalas to digest otherwise toxic eucalyptus leaves – their main food source. On a species level though, the disease, which spreads through bodily fluids, causes even greater ruin. Chlamydia is not uncommon in other animals – koalas are suspected to have first caught it from livestock – but the spread and intensity of the disease amongst the marsupials is unmatched. Experts estimate around half of koalas in Queensland and New South Wales could be infected, but just a suburb away from Currumbin, in Elanora, that has climbed beyond 80%. It is the most diseased population in the region and numbers have been ""falling off a cliff"", Dr Pyne says. ""It's a disaster."" Enter the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and their vaccine, which aims to prevent and treat chlamydia in koalas and has been almost two decades in the making. Alongside Currumbin, they're trying to save the Elanora koalas from oblivion: capturing 30 youngsters and vaccinating them, before recatching them at intervals over three years to track their health. So far only three of the vaccinated koalas in this research trial have contracted the disease, though all recovered, and encouragingly, more than two dozen joeys have been born - bucking the infertility trend. ""There's generations of koalas now that have come through. We've got grand joeys,"" Dr Pyne says excitedly. Currumbin has also been vaccinating every koala which comes through their hospital, and have reached about 400 koalas this way. But treating and vaccinating each koala with chlamydia costs them about A$7,000 (£3,500, $4,500). Capturing, jabbing, and tracking each wild Elanora koala is basically double that. Two hours away, researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) are doing their best to flatten the wave of disease too, with a separate vaccine. They inoculate about 2,000 koalas a year through wildlife hospital trials and tack themselves onto development projects or research studies in the region that involve their capture. They've just wrapped a decade's-worth of those projects into one study of more than 600 animals – the largest and longest of its kind. Incredibly, deaths dropped by two thirds among vaccinated koalas. Molecular biologist Samuel Phillips tells the BBC about one local koala population they studied which was at risk of extinction. Authorities are now looking at translocating some animals so they don't overpopulate the area. ""It turned it around completely."" And crucially, the study found that the koalas that did contract chlamydia were doing so later in life, after their peak breeding years had begun. Dr Phillips and his research partner Peter Timms have now submitted their vaccine to the federal regulator for approval but say they're keeping their hopes in check. ""There'll be hurdles,"" Dr Timms explains. In the meantime, for their small, overstretched team, dividing time and funding is an impossible balance. Do they involve themselves in as many trials as possible to help small groups of koalas now, or do they devote their efforts to advancing the tedious research and approval process which could help a huge cohort of them down the track? ""People come to us semi-regularly and say, 'Can we vaccinate more koalas?' And the answer at some point is 'No', because otherwise we're just spending all our time and energy doing [that],"" Dr Timms says. It has now been a decade since these two research teams first started seeing results, and there is still no real timeline on when a jab will be ready. And even when it is, there are huge barriers to any roll out. While making the vaccine isn't that costly, finding, capturing, and vaccinating wild koalas is extraordinarily expensive and time-consuming. Dr Phillips says they would have to strategically target select populations, though they're not yet sure how many koalas in each they'd need to treat to reverse decline. That challenge will be doubly complicated with the QUT vaccine, though, because it requires two doses, as opposed to UniSC's single-shot formula. The QUT team has been developing an implant – inspired by a human contraceptive device – that dissolves after four weeks to provide the booster. It will be trialled on Currumbin's captive koalas next year. Then there is the question of funding, which has been, and continues to be, fickle. Both vaccine developers provide their shots to wildlife hospitals and research trials for free, relying on individual donors, generosity from their universities, and the unpredictable whims of election cycles. State and federal governments are the biggest financial backers of the vaccine projects – last year Canberra gave QUT and UniSC A$750,000 each. ""No-one wants to imagine an Australia without koalas,"" Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said at the time. But government contributions are random, and never quite enough. ""I cannot believe somebody will not come along tomorrow and say 'You need to vaccinate? Here's my cheque to cover the next 10 years'. But we can't find them,"" Dr Timms says. However, the biggest barrier is the mountain of red tape researchers are yet to cut through. Both groups have conservation charities and wildlife hospitals knocking down the door, desperate for access, but until they go through the ""painful"" approval process, their hands are largely tied. ""[It's] a critical step that is just taking too long. It kills me,"" Dr Pyne says. ""We've kind of passed it being urgent. It was urgent probably 10 years ago."" Adding to their despondency, is a fact all involved stress repeatedly: the vaccine is simply not enough to save the species. And so even the lucky koalas like Joe Mangy, who dodge death by chlamydia and return to the wild, still must face off against a myriad of other mortal threats. ""It's death by a thousand cuts, right?"" Dr Timms says.",2024-12-29T16:03:09.183Z,Tiffanie Turnbull

Luke Walford, a youth pastor, had been spearfishing with his family when he was bitten on Saturday afternoon. He sustained ""life-threatening injuries"" and despite paramedics' efforts, he died at the scene about an hour later, authorities said. He and his family had been in the water at Humpy Island, in the Great Barrier Reef's Keppel Bay Islands National Park, when the attack happened. The area is a popular spot for diving and snorkelling. Walford had been a school chaplain and pastor at the Cathedral of Praise church in Rockhampton, Queensland. Donna Kirkland, his local MP, said she was in shock, and that Walford was a friend to her and ""countless others."" ""My prayers and heartfelt condolences are with his beautiful family and indeed the many who will be devastated, as I am, at this news"", she added. A family friend told ABC News he had watched the rescue helicopter fly over his house, unaware it was for his friend. ""I always say a little tribute for whoever it may be, but to find out it was Luke was a very sad day,"" Doug Webber said. Queensland police said a report would be prepared for the coroner. Australia's last fatal shark attack happened in December 2023, when a teenage boy was killed in the south. Just this year, there have been four other shark incidents in Australia, according to a local database.

The couple held a wedding ceremony in Sardinia in September, and were subsequently formally married at the service in Sydney, which was officiated by Wilson's sister. The actress proposed to Agruma, a fashion and jewellery designer, at Disneyland in 2023. Among well-wishers commenting on social media were Pitch Perfect co-stars Adam Devine and Elizabeth Banks, who offered their congratulations to the couple. Wilson, 44, said it felt ""right"" to get married in her hometown: ""It meant my 94-year-old grandmother Gar could come, which was very special to us to have her included,"" she wrote on Instagram. Agruma also shared photos from the day adding: ""Married officially in Australia to my Australian princess."" The couple are pictured beaming with the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge serving as the backdrop. The Bridesmaids actress announced the birth of her first child, via a surrogate in November 2022. Sharing a picture of daughter Royce Lilly, she described her as a ""beautiful miracle"". The star made headlines earlier this year when the US version of her memoir, Rebel Rising, which delved into Wilson's sexuality, weight and fertility, was released, and made allegations against Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen. The British edition of the book, published on 25 April, blacked out text believed to be relating to him. A spokesman for Baron Cohen at the time said the redactions represented a ""clear victory"", and reiterated the actor's position that Wilson's claims were ""demonstrably false"". In her memoir, Wilson also talked about being a ""late bloomer"" and losing her virginity at 35.",2024-12-29T12:01:12.885Z,Monica Rimmer
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j15l83v7jo,Two die in Sydney to Hobart yacht race,"Two people taking part in Australia's annual Sydney to Hobart yacht race have died in separate incidents, according to police. Both crew members died in separate incidents after being hit by a boom - the large pole attached horizontally to the bottom of a sail. The event's organisers said the incidents happened on the Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline. The first boats are expected to arrive in the city of Hobart, in Tasmania, later on Friday or early on Saturday. Several have already retired due to bad weather. New South Wales (NSW) police said the first incident was reported to officers just before midnight on Thursday local time (12:50 GMT) by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the country's capital, Canberra. Just over two hours later, at 02:15 on Friday, NSW police were told that crew aboard the second boat were giving CPR to the second person, which also had not worked. Flying Fish Arctos had been sailing approximately 30 nautical miles east/south-east of the NSW town of Ulladulla, the organisers said. Bowline, meanwhile, was approximately 30 nautical miles east/north-east of the town of Batemans Bay, also in NSW. ""Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased,"" the organisers said in a statement. ""The Sydney to Hobart is an Australian tradition, and it is heart-breaking that two lives have been lost at what should be a time of joy,"" said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The race, which began on Thursday, has continued. It is not the first time there have been fatalities during the race, which was first held in 1945.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c983dj1g2p3o,YouTuber Yung Filly pleads guilty to reckless driving in Australia,"British YouTuber Yung Filly has pleaded guilty to reckless driving in Australia while on bail over rape allegations. The 29-year-old, whose real name is Andrés Felipe Valencia Barrientos, admitted to driving at almost 60km/h (37mph) over the speed limit on a Perth highway last month. He is yet to enter a plea on eight sexual assault charges, over allegations he attacked a woman in his Perth hotel room after performing at a nightclub in September. Barrientos is best known for his work with the YouTube collective Beta Squad, and has presented shows on BBC Three. Barrientos appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday, where his lawyer said her client would enter a plea of guilty to the driving offence, which resulted in his car being impounded. The case was adjourned until 30 January, to be heard alongside Barrientos' other charges, which include four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm and one count of choking. The rapper was on tour in Australia performing his music when the alleged rape occurred. His bail conditions bar him from leaving the state of Western Australia or posting about the case on social media. Barrientos is a popular media figure in the UK, winning a Mobo Award for best media personality in 2021. He has also appeared on ITV's Soccer Aid and Channel 4's Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer.",2024-12-19T06:24:23.113Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9n4vyjy2mo,Australian radio host pleads not guilty to sex abuse,"Veteran Australian broadcaster Alan Jones has pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing 10 young men over almost two decades. The 83-year-old faces 34 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault. Mr Jones is one of Australia's most influential media figures and a former coach of its national rugby union team. He has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023. After appearing in court, he spoke publicly for the first time since his arrest last month, saying: ""I have never indecently assaulted these people."" ""I want you to understand this: these allegations are all either baseless or they distort the truth, and you should know that prior to my arrest I was given no opportunity by police to answer any of these allegations."" Mr Jones was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment on 18 November, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices. Originally charged in relation to eight people - including a 17-year-old boy - police have since filed additional charges, and say investigations are continuing. All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences. Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio and TV host personally, and that at least one had been employed by him. Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters last month. ""The law assumes that I am not guilty, and I am not guilty,"" Mr Jones told the media scrum waiting for him after his first court appearance in Sydney on Wednesday. ""That's all I can say at the moment, but I am emphatic that I'll be defending every charge before a jury in due course."" A former teacher, Mr Jones coached the Wallabies between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career. He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics. A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues. The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy. He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had ""died of shame"", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should ""shove a sock"" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern.",2024-12-18T02:22:49.385Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr2l1gvg3qo,Bali Nine drug smugglers 'relieved' to be back in Australia,"The five remaining members of the infamous ""Bali Nine"" drug ring say they are ""relieved and happy"" to be home in Australia, after serving nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons. Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj arrived in Darwin on Sunday following years of lobbying by Australia on their behalf. ""They look forward, in time, to reintegrating back into and contributing to society,"" said a statement issued on behalf of the men and their families. The high-profile case began in 2005 when Indonesia caught nine young Australians trying to smuggle 8.3kg (18lb) of heroin out of Bali strapped to their bodies. The eight men and one woman were arrested at an airport and hotel in Bali after a tip-off from Australian police. The case made global headlines when two of the gang's ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed by firing squad in 2015 - sparking a diplomatic row between neighbours Indonesia and Australia. Other members of the Bali Nine - most of whom were aged under 21 - were handed sentences of either 20 years or life in prison. The case put a spotlight on Indonesia's strict drug laws, some of the most stringent in the world. One of the nine, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died of cancer in prison in 2018. Shortly afterwards, Renae Lawrence, then 41, the only woman among the group, had her sentence commuted after spending almost 13 years in prison and returned to Australia the same year. Indonesia did not commute the sentences of the remaining five, now aged 38 to 48, and they were transported back to Australia as prisoners. However the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society. The five are banned for life from entering Indonesia, a spokesman for the government there said in a statement. On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken to several of the men's ""grateful"" parents. ""They did a serious crime and they have rightly paid a serious price for it. But it was time for them to come home,"" he told reporters. He said the deal did not come with conditions or favours Australia would have to repay: ""This is an act of compassion by President Prabowo [Subianto] and we thank him for it."" The men and their families also said they were ""immensely grateful"" to Prabowo. They also thanked the lawyers, diplomats and government figures who had helped advocate for them over the past two decades, before asking for privacy. ""The welfare of the men is a priority, they will need time and support, and we hope and trust our media and community will make allowance for this."" The five men are being put through medical checks at Darwin's Howard Springs facility - which was used for quarantine during the pandemic - and will begin a voluntary ""rehabilitation process"", Education Minister Jason Clare said. It is not clear what that entails, or how long the men will stay there. He added that normal visa processes would apply to any Indonesian family members of the men, who did not follow them to Australia. The Bishop of Townsville, Timothy Harris, who has supported the families of Scott Rush and Michael Czugaj since their arrests, said he immediately called Scott Rush's father Lee when he heard the news. Scott's parents are eagerly awaiting the reunion, Bishop Harris told the BBC. ""They are mortified by what their son did. They always believed he has committed a crime... But this turn of events [has] filled them with a sense of anticipation."" However, he said it would take time for the men to heal from their experience and re-integrate into society. ""If you think that through, your son commits a crime [and was] incarcerated in a foreign country, they return. How does someone get re-integrated into the family, let alone society?"" ""Things have changed. The relationships need to be rekindled. They are going to have to face that as time goes on,"" he said. ""Once [Scott's family] gets to embrace him... I hope and pray things will be better, because there's nothing like having your family [nearby].""",2024-12-16T05:36:04.816Z,Tiffanie Turnbull and Rachel Hagan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nkxrrnpzo,Pilot avoids jail over crash that killed UK tourist,"A pilot who caused a deadly light plane crash on an island in Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been spared a jail sentence. British tourist Jocelyn Spurway, 29, was killed and 21-year-old Irish woman Hannah O'Dowd seriously injured when the aircraft hit the sand on Middle Island in January 2017. A jury found pilot Leslie Woodall guilty of dangerously operating a vehicle causing death and grievous bodily harm, after a short trial which focused on his actions after the plane's engine suddenly failed. Woodall was given a two-year sentence, wholly suspended - which means he will remain free as long as he complies with certain conditions. The three-day trial in the Brisbane District Court was shown footage filmed by one of the three passengers inside the plane, which captured the moment the engine stopped and Woodall sharply turned the plane to the left. The Cessna 172N then rapidly lost altitude, before a wing hit the sand and it rolled. Ms Spurway suffered fatal spinal injuries, and her friend Ms O'Dowd was left with a traumatic brain injury and a series of fractures. Woodall also sustained serious injuries, and a 13-year-old boy who was on board suffered a broken ankle. Prosecutors argued it was not the engine failure that caused the crash, but rather Woodall's response to it. Aviation experts who gave evidence during the trial agreed that Woodall, an experienced pilot, went against flight training and best practice. He should have kept the wings level in order to glide and safely land, they said. However Woodall's defence team argued he had little other options available to him in a highly stressful situation. In a 2019 police interview played to the court he told officers he was trying to reach a sandbank, according to reports by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I decided not to land in the water as it was deep, and I was concerned about the risks of drowning and the risk of bull sharks,"" the pilot said. ""I truly believe I did everything I could to ensure the safety of those on board.""",2024-12-13T03:17:21.601Z,Tiffanie Turnbull

The 29-year-old, whose real name is Andrés Felipe Valencia Barrientos, is accused by police of driving past a speed camera at 158km/h (98mph) on a Perth highway last month. It is alleged to have occurred whilst Barrientos was on bail over an alleged attack on a woman in a Perth hotel in September. The BBC has contacted Barrientos's representatives for comment. When approached for comment, police said they were unable to confirm the charges by name but said a 29-year-old man had been charged with reckless driving. Police say the speeding incident happened on 17 November, in the High Wycombe area of Perth, where the speed limit is 100km/h, and his car was impounded. Barrientos will appear in court accused of reckless driving on 19 December, where he will also appear over four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm, and one count of impeding a person's normal breathing or circulation by applying pressure on or to their neck. It is alleged Barrientos brought a woman in her 20s back to his hotel room after he had performed at the nightclub Bar1 in Perth. The rapper was on tour in Australia performing his music.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4pvgjklevo,Australia to force tech giants to keep paying for news,"Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news. The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms. Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers. The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; £125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes. The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok. In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was ""charging one industry to subsidise another"". Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers. ""Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,"" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday. The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content. That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms. As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers. Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere. ""We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content… news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,"" it said in a statement in February. The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as ""a fundamental dereliction"" of Meta's ""responsibility to its Australian users"". ""The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,"" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time. The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February. The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue.",2024-12-12T06:13:53.742Z,Hannah Ritchie

The incident has been condemned by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a ""hate crime"". He told ABC News: ""There's no place for antisemitism in this country, or anywhere for that matter."" It comes days after a fire engulfed a synagogue in Melbourne, causing minor injuries to one man, in what police there are treating as a probable terror attack. Authorities in Sydney said they were seeking two people aged between 15 and 20 over the vandalism incident. The pair had been wearing ""face coverings and dark clothing"" and were seen running from the scene, New South Wales Police said. ""We need public assistance to come forward and help identify those two people,"" Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters. Police said the car blaze was extinguished shortly after firefighters were called to the scene in Woollahra, a suburb in Sydney's east, at around 01:00 local time (14:00 GMT). Anti-Israel messages, including ""Kill Israiel"" [sic], were found at the scene, scrawled on the fence of two properties and cars. The vehicle that was set on fire had been driven to the scene by the suspects, police said. Albanese said he had spoken to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) about the vandalism. Earlier this week, the law enforcement body established a special taskforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism, including the alleged terror attack in Melbourne, and another vandalism spree that occurred in Woollahra last month. Police do not believe the two incidents in Woollahra are linked.

Hoskins died in hospital on 30 December 2023, after being struck by a vehicle being driven by Dennis outside their home in Adelaide. The 34-year-old was initially charged with dangerous driving causing death and driving without due care, but on Tuesday he admitted a lesser charge - one aggravated count of creating the likelihood of harm. Dennis - who has two children with Hoskins - will be sentenced at a later date. Few details are known about the circumstances leading up to Hoskins's death. However, Dennis's guilty plea means he has admitted to driving a car when Hoskins was in close proximity, knowing that act was likely to cause harm or being recklessly indifferent to whether it would. ""There was no intention of Mr Dennis to harm his wife and this charge does not charge him with responsibility for her death,"" the retired athlete's lawyer told the court. Hoskins was a world champion in the team pursuit in 2015 and a two-time Olympian, and her death triggered a wave of tributes from around the world. She and Dennis married in 2018. Dennis retired at the end of the 2023 season after a career in which he won stages at the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana.

Three suspects are being hunted over Friday's early-morning blaze, which left one man with a minor burn to his hand and caused extensive damage. Witnesses say they saw masked figures spreading what appeared to be an accelerant in the building, before setting it alight. Victoria Police say they have no evidence that further antisemitic attacks are planned, but patrols are being increased to reassure the community. After a meeting with Australian Federal Police and domestic spy agency Asio, the state police force said additional ""intelligence"" had led them to conclude the incident should be treated as a probable terror attack. Commissioner Shane Patton said police had no information before the fire to suggest an arson attack was imminent. He declined to provide any further details on the investigation while it continued. Mr Patton's declaration came a day after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the incident as ""quite clearly terrorism"" while acknowledging police were still to make up their minds. He called his description a ""personal view"". On Monday, state Premier Jacinta Allan said the terror designation meant police would now have extra resources for their investigation. Jewish community leaders have said they believe the attack is an escalation of a recent documented increase in antisemitism in Australia, and that it has heightened fears of violence. A few worshippers were inside the building at the time of the fire, and have described hearing banging and seeing a window smash, before liquids were thrown inside and lit on fire. ""The whole thing took off pretty quickly,"" synagogue board member Benjamin Klein, who spoke to witnesses, told The Age newspaper. After officers at the scene were confronted by angry and scared worshippers on Friday, Mr Patton said police were focused on ensuring their safety. ""We have... extra police officers deployed in those areas where there are high numbers of Jewish persons living and congregating,"" he said. Allan also called for the city to rally behind its Jewish communities. ""We cannot let this conflict overseas continue to be a cloak for behaviour like [this]."" Albanese also on Monday announced a new federal strikeforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism.

In a statement to the Guardian, Gunn's legal and management team said it was committed to protecting her intellectual property and ensuring that her brand remained strong and respected. Some of Gunn's unconventional moves - such as the sprinkler and kangaroo-hop - went viral after her Olympics performance. Now, Gunn's lawyers have reportedly trademarked the poster for the musical and advised Broadbridge that she was ""not allowed"" to do the kangaroo dance because Gunn ""owns"" it. ""That one did puzzle me - I mean, that's an Olympic-level dance,"" Broadbridge said in her Instagram video. ""How would I possibly be able to do that without any formal breakdancing training?"" Broadbridge said on Instagram that she planned for the show to be ""back soon"" and ""with a whole new story arc"". Everyone who was due to attend the trial show would be offered a refund for their A$10 ticket, she added. She said: ""They [Gunn's legal team] were worried I was damaging her brand, which I would never."" Gunn failed to receive a single point from judges at this summer's Olympic games and was subsequently eliminated from the round-robin stage which led to a torrent of abuse online. Despite being defended by officials, her performance divided opinion within the breaking community, with some saying she made a mockery of the scene. Gunn had initially planned to keep competing after the Olympics, but in November said the saga had been so ""upsetting"" that she changed her mind and had decided to retire. She ended her video saying that she intends to change the name of her character to ""Raygun with an I"" in hopes that ""fixes everyone's concerns"". In their statement to The Guardian, Gunn's legal team said: ""While we have immense respect for the credible work and effort that has gone into the development of the show, we must take necessary steps to safeguard Rachael's creative rights and the integrity of her work. ""This action is not intended to diminish the contributions of others, but rather to ensure her brand is properly represented and protected in all future endeavours.""",2024-12-08T17:39:49.005Z,Emma Rossiter
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ydr228jyko,Worshippers flee arson attack at Melbourne synagogue,"Worshippers were forced to flee an Australian synagogue after it was set on fire in what the prime minister condemned as an ""act of hate"". Firefighters were called to Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue just after 04:00 local time on Friday (17:00 GMT Thursday) and arrived to find the building fully ablaze. Community leaders told local media that ""a few people"" were inside at the time for morning prayers, and they had reported seeing firebombs thrown. One person was injured and the fire caused extensive damage. Police say they believe the fire was deliberately lit but are keeping an ""open mind"" on a motive. In a statement, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the incident in Ripponlea, in the city's south-east, was ""clearly aimed at creating fear in the community"". ""This violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is an outrage,"" he wrote. ""I have zero tolerance for antisemitism."" He added that he had been briefed by the Australian Federal Police, who would provide support to authorities in the state of Victoria. ""The people involved must be caught and face the full force of the law."" Victoria Police said the exact cause of the fire had not yet been determined and an arson chemist would visit the site. However Det Insp Chris Murray said a witness had told them two people in masks appeared to have spread accelerant inside the building. ""We believe it was deliberate. We believe it has been targeted,"" he added. ""What we don't know is why."" He appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage from the local area, to contact police. Synagogue board member Benjamin Klein told The Age newspaper that people inside ""heard banging on the door and the window, and some liquids came through which were lit"". ""The whole thing took off pretty quickly,"" he said. A man who was inside at the time, Yumi Friedman, added that a window had been smashed, sending ""glass flying"". Mr Friedman told reporters his hand was burned on a door knob when he tried to return to the synagogue to fight the blaze. Det Insp Murray - who was confronted by an angry worshipper while updating the press - said police would be committing significant resources to the investigation and increasing patrols around the area. ""We're going to do our best to make sure that they can return, as they should, to their local synagogues, doing what is absolutely Australian - that is to be able to worship without fear."" Jewish community leaders have said they believe the attack is an escalation of a recent documented increase in antisemitism in Australia. ""None of the Jewish community is surprised. We've known this has been coming,"" Executive Council of Australian Jewry president Daniel Aghion said.",2024-12-06T12:06:30.233Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8y4zxred7o,Australian suspect in 1977 murders extradited from Italy,"A man wanted over one of Australia's most infamous cold cases, dubbed the Easey Street murders, has arrived in Melbourne after being extradited from Italy. Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were stabbed to death in their Melbourne house in 1977, in a case which has gripped the nation ever since. Police said suspect Perry Kouroumblis, 65, only became the focus of their investigation in recent years after DNA testing breakthroughs. Mr Kouroumblis - who has not been charged and maintains his innocence - was detained in Italy in September. If charged, he is expected to face court later this week, according to local media. Mr Kouroumblis first came to police attention the week after the murders, when the then 17-year-old said he had found a bloodied knife near the scene in Easey Street, Collingwood, an inner-city suburb. The bodies of the high school friends were discovered three days after they were last seen alive. Ms Armstrong's one-year-old son was also found in the home, unharmed in his cot. Both women had been stabbed more than a dozen times and Ms Armstrong had been sexually assaulted, police say. The case has long drawn huge interest - becoming the subject of major police appeals, true crime books and a hit podcast. In 2017 Victoria Police offered a A$1m (£511,800, $647,600) reward for information. Commissioner Shane Patton described the murders as ""an absolutely gruesome, horrific, frenzied homicide"" when announcing the arrest of Mr Kouroumblis - a dual Greek-Australian citizen - in Rome in September. ""This was a crime that struck at the heart of our community - two women in their own home, where they should have felt their safest,"" he said. Police had issued an Interpol red notice for Mr Kouroumblis on two charges of murder and one of rape, after he left Australia about seven years ago. But he was not able to be arrested in Greece, where he had been living, as the country's law requires murder charges to be laid within 20 years of an alleged crime. At the time of Mr Kouroumblis's arrest, the women's families released a statement, saying their lives had been changed ""irrevocably"" by the murders. ""For two quiet families from country Victoria it has always been impossible to comprehend the needless and violent manner in which Suzanne and Susan died,"" the statement read. Addressing police, they said: ""For always giving us hope and never giving up, we simply say, thank you.""  ",2024-12-03T14:15:26.368Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gznvw3wneo,Childcare worker who abused more than 60 girls jailed for life,"A former childcare worker dubbed ""one of Australia's worst paedophiles"" has been sentenced to life in prison for raping and sexually abusing almost 70 girls. Ashley Paul Griffith, 47, confessed to 307 offences committed at childcare centres in the Australian state of Queensland and overseas between 2003 and 2022. His victims were aged between one and seven. Judge Paul Smith called the scale and nature of the crimes ""depraved"" and ""horrendous"", saying ""there was a significant breach of trust"". In addition to this case, the BBC understands Griffith is separately accused of abusing at least two dozen children in the Australian state of New South Wales and in Italy. In the Brisbane District Court on Friday, Judge Smith said Griffith - who the court heard had a ""paedophilic disorder"" - had a high risk of reoffending, ordering a non-parole period of at least 27 years. Griffith was first arrested in August 2022 by the Australian Federal Police, and a year later charged with more than 1,600 child sex offences. Most of these were eventually dropped. Warning: This story contains details readers might find distressing Investigators found thousands of photographs and videos of his abuse, which he had filmed and uploaded onto the dark web. Although faces were cropped out of the footage, they managed to trace them to Griffith because of a unique set of bedsheets seen in the background of some of the videos, which had been sold to childcare centres across Queensland. He pleaded guilty to 28 counts of rape, almost 200 charges relating to indecent treatment of a child, and several related to making and sharing child exploitation material. Four of the girls who featured in his videos were from a childcare centre in Pisa, Italy. His other 65 victims were from 11 locations across Brisbane. Ahead of his sentence behind handed down, the court heard a string of emotional statements from some of those victims and their parents - who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Among them were two sisters who were abused in kindergarten, one of whom recalled Griffith being her favourite teacher. ""To find out what he was really doing was devastating... I don’t seem to be able to process it even now, because there’s a disconnect between what I remember and the reality,"" she said, according to The Courier Mail. Another woman told how his actions had robbed her of a normal childhood, recounting her struggles with mental illness in the years since. ""I will never know what my life could have been like,"" she is quoted as saying, in an article by The Guardian Australia. ""I can never know what it would have been to grow up unafraid of people."" Parents meanwhile told the court of their horror upon discovering the crimes inflicted upon their children, with several saying they struggled to forgive themselves for trusting Griffith. ""(My daughter) loved you like an uncle and you used her like a toy,"" one said, according to News Corp Australia. Another explained how she was trying to keep the burden of knowledge of the abuse from her daughter. ""I cannot undo what you did to her body but will do everything I can to limit the damage to her mind,"" she said, according to the Courier Mail. Outside court, the families called for an investigation into the childcare centres - and broader system - in which Griffith was able to go undetected for so long. ""Parents are walking their children into these centres today with a false sense of security,"" one father told reporters.",2024-11-29T05:26:47.876Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89vjj0lxx9o,Australia approves social media ban on under-16s,"Australia will ban children under 16 from using social media, after its parliament approved the world's strictest laws. The ban, which will not take effect for at least 12 months, could see tech companies fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they don't comply. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the legislation is needed to protect young people from the ""harms"" of social media, something many parent groups have echoed. But critics say questions over how the ban will work - and its impact on privacy and social connection - have been left unanswered. This is not the first attempt globally to restrict children's social media use, but the minimum age of 16 is the highest set by any country. Unlike other attempts, it also does not include exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent. Having passed the Senate by 34 votes to 19 late on Thursday, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where it passed early on Friday. “We want our kids to have a childhood and parents to know we have their backs,"" Albanese told reporters afterwards. The legislation does not specify which platforms will be banned. Those decisions will be made later by Australia’s communications minister, who will seek advice from the eSafety Commissioner - an internet regulator that will enforce the rules. However the minister, Michelle Rowland, has said the ban will include Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and X. Gaming and messaging platforms are exempt, as are sites that can be accessed without an account, meaning YouTube, for instance, is likely to be spared. The government says will it rely on some form of age-verification technology to implement the restrictions, and options will be tested in the coming months. The onus will be on the social media platforms to add these processes themselves. However digital researchers have warned there are no guarantees the unspecified technology - which could rely on biometrics or identity information - will work. Critics have also sought assurances that privacy will be protected. They have also warned that restrictions could easily be circumvented through tools like a VPN - which can disguise a user’s location and make them appear to be logging on from another country. Children who find ways to flout the rules will not face penalties, however. Polling on the reforms, though limited, suggests it is supported by a majority of Australian parents and caregivers. ""For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out,"" Amy Friedlander, who was among those lobbying for the ban, recently told the BBC. ""We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of."" But many experts say the ban is ""too blunt an instrument"" to effectively address the risks associated with social media use, and have warned it could end up pushing children into less regulated corners of the internet. During a short consultation period before the bill passed, Google and Snap criticised the legislation for not providing more detail, and Meta said the bill would be ""ineffective"" and not meet its stated aim of making kids safer. In its submission, TikTok said the government’s definition of a social media platform was so ""broad and unclear"" that ""almost every online service could fall within [it]"". X questioned the ""lawfulness"" of the bill - saying it may not be compatible with international regulations and human rights treaties which Australia has signed. Some youth advocates also accused the government of not fully understanding the role social media plays in their lives, and locking them out of the debate. ""We understand we are vulnerable to the risks and negative impacts of social media… but we need to be involved in developing solutions,"" wrote the eSafety Youth Council, which advises the regulator. Albanese has acknowledged the debate is complex but steadfastly defended the bill. ""We don't argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for [children] under 18 doesn’t mean that someone under 18 never has access – but we know that it’s the right thing to do,"" he said on Friday. Last year, France introduced legislation to block social media access for children under 15 without parental consent, though research indicates almost half of users were able to avoid the ban using a VPN. A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - was overturned by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional. Australia’s laws are being watched with great interest by global leaders. Norway has recently pledged to follow in the country’s footsteps, and last week the UK’s technology secretary said a similar ban was “on the table” - though he later added “not... at the moment”.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp7g9r8j5o,Officer who Tasered 95-year-old guilty of manslaughter,"A police officer who Tasered a 95-year-old woman with dementia symptoms at an Australian care home has been found guilty of her manslaughter. Kristian White, 34, used his weapon on Clare Nowland after the great-grandmother was found wandering with a small kitchen knife in the early hours of 17 May 2023. Her death a week later caused public outcry, but White - a senior constable - argued at trial that his use of force was reasonable and proportionate to the threat. Prosecutors, however, said Mrs Nowland - who relied on a walker to get around and weighed under 48kg (105lb) - was not a danger and that the ""impatient"" officer had neglected his duty of care to her. Police and paramedics were called to Yallambee Lodge - in the town of Cooma about 114km (71 miles) south of Canberra – around 04:00 on the day of the incident, after Mrs Nowland had been seen roaming the care home with two serrated steak knives. The trial in the New South Wales (NSW) Supreme Court heard that Mrs Nowland, while not formally diagnosed with dementia, had been displaying signs of cognitive decline in the months leading up to her death and had at times behaved aggressively towards healthcare workers. At one point that night she had entered the room of another resident holding the knives, though he told the court he did not feel unsafe, and she had also later thrown one of the blades at a staff member. When emergency services found Mrs Nowland, they repeatedly asked her to drop the knife in her right hand, and – using thick gloves – had tried to disarm her themselves, the court was told. In the moments before she was hit by the Taser, footage played to the jury showed the elderly woman using her walker to slowly shuffle forward - 1m (3.3ft) over the course of a minute - before stopping and raising the blade. White warned Mrs Nowland his weapon was aimed at her, before saying ""bugger it"" and firing it, while she was still 1.5m-2m away. She fell and hit her head, triggering a fatal brain bleed. “Who could she have injured at that moment? No one,” Crown prosecutor Brett Hatfield said, summing up his case for the jury last week. He said White had used his weapon only three minutes after finding the woman: “He was fed up, impatient, not prepared to wait any longer.” However in a written incident report, the officer - who had been stood down from duties while facing court - said he deployed his Taser because he felt a “violent confrontation was imminent”. In court he added that he didn’t think Mrs Nowland would be “significantly injured” and that he was “devastated” by her death. The defence pointed to evidence from one of the paramedics and White’s police partner, who both said Mrs Nowland had made them feel scared for their safety. ""I thought that I was going to be stabbed,” Jessica Pank, also a senior constable, said. However, both agreed they could have easily moved to safety, given Mrs Nowland’s limited mobility. Mrs Nowland's family, who were in court to hear the jury's verdict, thanked prosecutors, the judge and the jury. ""The family will take some time to come to terms with the jury’s confirmation that Clare’s death at the hands of a serving NSW police officer was a criminal and unjustified act,"" they said in a statement issued by a lawyer, which also asked for privacy. NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb on Wednesday said White's employment was still under legal review. She added that the force's Taser policies and training had also been reviewed but found to be appropriate. ""The death of Clare Nowland is a terrible tragedy... this should never have happened,"" she said. White, who remains on bail, will be sentenced at a later date.",2024-11-27T05:52:38.371Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5z4j3y2xo,Katy Perry v Katie Perry: Singer wins right to use name in Australia,"Singer Katy Perry has successfully appealed against a trademark decision over her name, after being sued by an Australian designer who sells clothes under her birth name Katie Perry. Three appeals judges on Friday overturned a court decision last year that favoured Katie Taylor over merchandise sold by the pop star during a 2014 tour of Australia. The judges said Perry had been using her name as a trademark five years before Taylor started her business, adding that by that time, Perry had attained an ""international reputation"" in entertainment. The judges also cancelled Taylor's trademark registration on Friday. Taylor had likened her legal battle with Perry to ""David and Goliath"". She told the Sydney Morning Herald after Friday's ruling that she was ""devastated"" with the case outcome. The appeals judges said it was ""unfortunate"" that the case pitted two enterprising women who used their names as trademarks but were unaware that the other existed. “Both women put blood, sweat and tears into developing their businesses,” the judges said. “As the fame of one grew internationally, the other became aware of her namesake and filed a trademark application,” they said. The judge who ruled in favour of Taylor last year referenced one of Perry's biggest hits in her decision: ""This is a tale of two women, two teenage dreams and one name"". Friday's ruling comes as Perry prepares for her Lifetimes world tour in early 2025 to support her comeback album 143.",2024-11-22T08:03:56.142Z,Joel Guinto
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl4dyjg57do,Australia wants to ban kids from social media. Will it work?,"“I felt really scared to be honest,” says James, describing an incident on Snapchat that left him questioning whether it was safe to go to school. The Australian boy, 12, had had a disagreement with a friend, and one night before bed the boy added him to a group chat with two older teenagers. Almost instantly, his phone “started blowing up” with a string of violent messages. “One of them sounded like he was probably 17,” James tells the BBC. “He sent me videos of him with a machete… he was waving it around. Then there were voice messages saying that they were going to catch me and stab me.” James - not his real name - first joined Snapchat when he was 10, after a classmate suggested everyone in their friendship group get the app. But after telling his parents about his cyberbullying experience, which was ultimately resolved by his school, James deleted his account. His experience is a cautionary tale that shows why the Australian government’s proposed social media ban on children under 16 is necessary, says his mother Emma, who is also using a pseudonym. The laws, which were tabled in parliament's lower house on Thursday, have been billed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as “world-leading”. But while many parents have applauded the move, some experts have questioned whether kids should - or even can - be barred from accessing social media, and what the adverse effects of doing so may be. Albanese says the ban - which will cover platforms such as X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram - is about protecting kids from the “harms” of social media. ""This is a global problem and we want young Australians essentially to have a childhood. We want parents to have peace of mind,"" he said on Thursday. The new legislation provides a ""framework"" for the ban. But the 17-page document, which is expected to head to the Senate next week, is sparse on detail. Instead, it will be up to the nation’s internet regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to hash out how to implement and enforce the rules, which will not come into effect for at least 12 months after legislation is passed. According to the bill, the ban will apply to all children under 16 and that there will be no exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent. Tech companies will face penalties of up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7) if they do not comply, but there will be exemptions for platforms which are able to create “low-risk services"" deemed suitable for kids. Criteria for this threshold are yet to be set. Messaging services and gaming sites, however, will not be restricted, as will some sites that can be accessed without an account like YouTube, which has prompted questions over how regulators will determine what is and isn’t a social media platform in a fast-moving landscape. A group representing the interests of tech companies such as Meta, Snapchat and X in Australia has dismissed the ban as “a 20th Century response to 21st Century challenges”. Such legislation could push kids into “dangerous, unregulated parts of the internet”, Digital Industry Group Inc says - a fear also expressed by some experts. eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant has acknowledged the gargantuan task her office will face when enforcing the ban, given “technology change is always going to outpace policy”. “It will always be fluid, and this is why regulators like eSafety have to be nimble,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live. But Ms Inman Grant has also raised concerns about the central idea behind the government’s policy, which is that there’s a causal link between social media and declining mental health. “I would say that the evidence base is not settled at all,” she said, pointing to research from her own office which found that some of the most vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+ or First Nations teenagers, “feel more themselves online than they do in the real world”. This is a sentiment echoed by Lucas Lane, 15, who runs an online business selling nail polish to boys. “This [ban] destroys… my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen,” the Perth teenager tells the BBC. Ms Inman Grant would rather see tech companies clean up their platforms, as well as more investment in education tools to help young people stay safe online. She uses the analogy of teaching children to swim, rather than banning them from the water. “We don’t fence the ocean… but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,” she told parliament earlier this year. But Emma - who has lobbied for the ban through the parent-led Heads Up Alliance - sees it differently. “Should we really be wasting our time trying to help kids navigate these difficult systems when tech companies just want them on them all the time?"" she says. “Or should we just allow them to be kids and learn how to be sociable outside with each other, and then start these discussions later on?” Amy Friedlander, a mother of three from the Wait Mate movement - which encourages parents to delay giving their kids smartphones - agrees. “We can’t ignore all the positives that technology has brought into our lives. There are huge upsides, but what we haven’t really considered is the impact it is having on brains which aren’t ready for it.” Over 100 Australian academics have criticised the ban as ""too blunt an instrument"" and argued that it goes against UN advice which calls on governments to ensure young people have “safe access” to digital environments. It has also failed to win the backing of a bipartisan parliamentary committee that’s been examining the impact of social media on adolescents. Instead, the committee recommended that tech giants face tougher regulations. To address some of those concerns, the government says it will eventually introduce ""digital duty of care"" laws, which will make it a legal obligation for tech companies to prioritise user safety. Joanne Orlando, a researcher in digital behaviour, argues that while a ban “could be part of a strategy, it absolutely can’t be the whole strategy”. She says “the biggest piece of the puzzle” should be educating kids to think critically about the content they see on their feeds and how they use social media. The government has already spent A$6m since 2022 to develop free “digital literacy tools” to try and do just that. However, research suggests that many young Australians aren’t receiving regular lessons. Ms Orlando and other experts warn there are also significant hurdles to making the age-verification technology - which is required to enforce the ban - effective and safe, given the “enormous risks” associated with potentially housing the identification documents of every Australian online. The government has said it is aiming to solve that challenge through age-verification trials, and hopes to table a report by mid-next year. It has promised that privacy concerns will be front and centre, but offered little detail on what kind of technology will actually be tested. In its advice, the eSafety Commissioner has floated the idea of using a third-party service to anonymise a user’s ID before it is passed on to any age verification sites, to “preserve” their privacy. However, Ms Orlando remains sceptical. “I can’t think of any technology that exists at this point that can pull this off,” she tells the BBC. Australia is by no means the first country to try to restrict how young people access certain websites or platforms online. In 2011, South Korea passed its “shutdown law” which prevented children under 16 from playing internet games between 22:30 and 6:00, but the rules - which faced backlash - were later scrapped citing the need to “respect the rights of youths”. More recently France introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent. Research indicated almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN. A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - ran into a different issue: it was blocked by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional. Albanese has conceded that Australia's proposal may not be foolproof, and if it passes the parliament, it would be subject to a review. ""We all know technology moves fast and some people will try to find ways around these new laws but that is not a reason to ignore the responsibility that we have,"" he told lawmakers. But for mothers like Emma and Ms Friedlander - who have lobbied for the changes - it's the message that the ban sends which matters most. “For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out socially,” Ms Friedlander says. “We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.” James says that since quitting Snapchat he’s found himself spending more time outside with friends. And he hopes that the new laws could enable more kids like him to “get out and do the things they love” instead of feeling pressured to be online.",2024-11-21T04:04:33.360Z,Hannah Ritchie
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz84jy9ypo,Uncertainty after Australia foreign students bill hits opposition,"Australia's debate over capping foreign student numbers is “not over” despite a controversial bill unexpectedly losing support, a top industry body says. The bill, part of efforts to slash overall migration to Australia, had been opposed by most universities who say it would damage the higher education sector and its global reputation. The government argued the legislation was needed to make the industry more sustainable and ease pressure on housing, and it was expected to easily pass with opposition support this week. However in a surprise eleventh-hour move, Australia's opposition leader said his coalition would vote against the bill as it didn't go far enough. Though some universities have expressed support at the bill's apparent demise, they also say it extends the uncertainty surrounding the industry - which is worth about A$50bn (£25.7bn, $32.7bn) to the economy. Luke Sheehy, head of Universities Australia, told the BBC the news brought ""no sense of relief"" for him. ""I just knew that we would be looking at international students [used] as cannon fodder in a phoney war on migration right through to the election now,"" said Mr Sheehy, whose organisation advocates for 39 universities. The cap proposed limiting new enrolments at 270,000 for 2025 - a significant cut on the number in 2024. It had been due to come into effect in just six weeks. Some universities have made job cuts and rejected student applications in anticipation of the new laws, and the BBC was told foreign students were already choosing to study elsewhere as a result of the reduced confidence in the sector. The legislation, currently before the Senate, has not been formally withdrawn by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government but it cannot pass without the support of the main opposition Liberal-National coalition or the Greens, who also oppose it. Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton called the bill ""a dog's breakfast"" and vowed to introduce ""deeper cuts"" if he wins the upcoming election, due by May. The Greens, on the other hand, described the bill ""dog whistling that shamefully scapegoated international students for the housing crisis they did not cause"". The government has accused Mr Dutton of hypocrisy, arguing he has often talked ""tough"" on cutting immigration to the country, which has reached record levels in recent years. The expected failure of the bill would mean an existing visa policy, which has been widely accused of exacerbating problems by funnelling most international students to a select few city-based universities, will remain in place. The Group of Eight (Go8) - a body which represents Australia’s top ranked universities - said the bill would have hurt students and staff and that common sense had prevailed. But the industry has been left scrambling again, with only a few months left until the 2025 academic year begins. Observers say some universities could now receive a spike in students when they had a expected a cut, and others - predominantly in regional locations - will no longer expect as many, putting them under greater financial pressure. ""The most devastating part of this discussion is that we still don't have a resolution,"" Mr Sheehy said. ""We're nowhere closer to providing the certainty, stability and growth the government promised us all those many months ago when they proposed caps.""",2024-11-21T00:25:28.211Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0memjm3jro,Australian senator censured for heckling King,"Australian lawmakers have voted to censure an Aboriginal senator who heckled King Charles during his visit to Canberra last month, to express their ""profound disapproval"" of her protest. Lidia Thorpe shouted ""you are not my King"" and ""this is not your land"" shortly after the King addressed the Great Hall of Parliament, in an effort to highlight the impacts of British colonisation. The Senate's censure, which passed 46-12, described Thorpe's actions as ""disrespectful and disruptive"" and said they should disqualify her from representing the chamber as a member of any delegation. A censure motion is politically symbolic but carries no constitutional or legal weight. Shortly after the Senate vote on Monday, Thorpe told reporters she had been denied her right to respond in the chamber due to a flight delay. ""The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the first peoples of this country... I will not be silent,"" the independent senator said. Her protest last month drew immediate ire from across the political aisle, as well as from some prominent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders. But it also drew praise from some activists who argued that it highlighted the plight of Australia's first inhabitants, who endured colonial violence and still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians. Thorpe is among those who have advocated for a treaty between Australia’s government and its first inhabitants. Unlike New Zealand and other former British colonies, a treaty with Indigenous peoples in Australia was never established. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people emphasise that they never ceded their sovereignty or land to the Crown. Despite the protest, the King was warmly greeted by Australian crowds during his five-day tour alongside Queen Camilla. “You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown. Nothing stands still,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in an official address. Thorpe has a history of Indigenous activism which has, at times, grabbed global headlines. During her swearing in ceremony in 2022, the Gunnai, Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung woman referred to the Queen Elizabeth II as a coloniser - and was asked to retake her oath after facing criticism. Last year, Australia decisively rejected a proposal to grant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people constitutional recognition and allow them to establish a body to advise parliament on issues impacting their communities. The referendum - known as the Voice - became ensnared in a bruising campaign, and both sides of politics have sought to move on swiftly, leaving uncertainty over future policy. While the data suggests a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn’t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading ‘No’ campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic.",2024-11-18T10:54:04.126Z,Hannah Ritchie
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27v4v1l5wo,Top radio host charged with sexually abusing eight people,"Veteran Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has been charged with sexually abusing seven men and a 17-year-old boy. The 83-year-old was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment early on Monday morning, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices. Mr Jones is one of Australia’s most influential media figures, and has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023. He now faces 24 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault. All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences. Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio titan personally, and that at least one had been employed by him. Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters. ""I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. [They] have now got the ability to have a voice. This is what they've been asking for,"" he said. Commissioner Karen Webb earlier said police had conducted a ""very complex"", ""protracted"" and ""thorough"" investigation, and expected other alleged victims may now come forward. ""There's no such thing as a matter that's too old to be investigated,"" she said at a press conference. ""You will be listened to, and we will take your matter seriously."" Mr Jones has been granted conditional bail, and will face court on 18 December. A former teacher, Mr Jones coached Australia's national rugby union team between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career. He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics. A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues. The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy. He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had ""died of shame"", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should ""shove a sock"" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern. Mr Jones has also been successfully sued for defamation many times.",2024-11-18T05:25:50.560Z,Tiffanie Turnbull
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvkxdxprlo,"Bondi attacker stabbed 16 in three minutes, inquiry told","It took just three minutes for Joel Cauchi to fatally stab six people and injure 10 more during a rampage at a popular Sydney shopping centre, an inquest into the attack has been told. The New South Wales Coroner's Court heard on Tuesday that Cauchi, 40, was knife-obsessed and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but had come off his medication and was homeless at the time of the incident. The inquiry also heard that no alarm sounded inside the centre until after Cauchi had been shot dead by police. The incident on 13 April devastated Australia, where mass murder is rare, and prompted a national conversation about gendered violence. All up, 14 of the 16 people stabbed that day were female - including five of the six who were killed, and a nine-month-old baby. The NSW police commissioner said at the time that it was ""obvious"" Cauchi had targeted women. Tuesday's hearing laid out the areas of focus for an extensive inquiry which is due to begin in full in April 2025. The investigation will look into possible security lapses and failings in the mental health systems in NSW and Queensland, Cauchi's home state. Speaking in court, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC, the counsel assisting the coroner, said Cauchi had been off his psychotropic medication since 2019, despite authorities being repeatedly warned of his deteriorating state. Cauchi had come ""to the attention"" of Queensland police several times, she added. In her statement, Dwyer also provided the first detailed timeline of how the violence actually unfolded in Bondi that day. She said that Cauchi - who had been sleeping rough in the suburb of Maroubra on the morning of the attack - entered Westfield shopping centre around 15.30 (local), and began stabbing people roughly three minutes later, after removing his knife in line at a bakery. His first victim was Dawn Singleton, 25, followed by 47-year-old Jade Young and 25-year-old Yixuan Cheng. He then attacked Ashlee Good, 38, from behind. Good - who has been described by her family as an ""all-round outstanding human"" - then saw Cauchi stabbing her nine-month-old baby girl in her pram, and was further wounded trying to save the child's life, the court heard. Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old security guard, was stabbed next, alongside a colleague. Onlookers at the time said he died ""trying to save others"". Cauchi fatally stabbed Pikria Darchia, 55, before being shot dead by NSW Police Insp Amy Scott, who had been on duty close by. Between the moment Insp Scott arrived and the moment she killed Cauchi just over a minute had passed, the court heard. In total, the attack lasted for five minutes and 43 seconds - yet no alarm sounded during that time. ""It’s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound,"" Dwyer said. Before opening the hearing, state coroner Teresa O’Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss the broader community was still feeling as a result of the violence. ""I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can’t be here in person,"" she told the court, according to the Guardian Australia. ""It’s important to me and my assisting team… that you feel safe, you feel heard and you feel cared for throughout this proceeding.""",2024-11-12T05:17:31.917Z,Hannah Ritchie
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20py1lvz8o,Policeman convicted for viral torture video found dead in jail,"A former Thai police chief who was jailed for life three years ago for torturing a drug suspect to death has been found dead in his Bangkok jail cell, authorities said. Thitisan Utthanaphon, who was nicknamed Joe Ferrari for his many luxury cars, died by suicide, according to a preliminary autopsy. In 2021, a leaked video showed Thitisan and his colleagues wrapping plastic bags around the head of a 24-year-old drug suspect during an interrogation, leading to the suspect's death. The video sparked national outrage at that time over police brutality in Thailand. It has made fresh rounds on social media in the wake of Thitisan's death. Thailand's justice ministry has launched an investigation into his death after his family expressed doubts that he killed himself. Further tests were needed to confirm that he had indeed died in a suicide, authorities said. Justice minister Tawee Sodsong said on Monday that all evidence related to Thitisan's death should be disclosed, and urged prison authorities to cooperate with investigators. The family said Thitisan was previously assaulted by a prison staffer. They said officials did not allow them to see his body, which was found in his cell on Friday. But on Sunday authorities said ""no prison officer or inmate has harmed or caused [his] death"". A previous raid on Thitisan's house revealed that he owned a dozen luxury sportscars. Authorities believe he owned at least 42, one of them a rare Lamborghini Aventador Anniversario, of which only 100 were made, priced in Thailand at 47 million baht ($1.45m; £1.05m). As a police colonel, Thitisan was paid about $1,000 a month. There were allegations that he demanded bribes from the suspect in the viral video, Jirapong Thanapat, while suffocating him. Thitisan denied this. Thitisan surrendered in 2021 following a manhunt. Besides Thitisan, five other police officers were convicted of murdering Jirapong and were also sentenced to life in prison in 2022. ""It's like he has paid off the karma he committed,"" Jirapong's father said in an interview on local media on Saturday. The Department of Corrections said they had been investigating a previous complaint filed by Thitisan's family alleging that he had been bullied and assaulted by prison officers earlier this year. Thitisan had consulted doctors over anxiety issues and trouble sleeping, the department said. His family visited him on the day that he died and prison staff did not notice any ""abnormalities"", it said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kgndwwd7lo,North Korean hackers cash out hundreds of millions from $1.5bn ByBit hack,"Hackers thought to be working for the North Korean regime have successfully converted at least $300m (£232m) of their record-breaking $1.5bn crypto heist to unrecoverable funds. The criminals, known as Lazarus Group, swiped the huge haul of digital tokens in a hack on crypto exchange ByBit two weeks ago. Since then, it's been a cat-and-mouse game to track and block the hackers from successfully converting the crypto into usable cash. Experts say the infamous hacking team is working nearly 24 hours a day - potentially funnelling the money into the regime's military development. ""Every minute matters for the hackers who are trying to confuse the money trail and they are extremely sophisticated in what they're doing,"" says Dr Tom Robinson, co-founder of crypto investigators Elliptic. Out of all the criminal actors involved in crypto currency, North Korea is the best at laundering crypto, Dr Robinson says. ""I imagine they have an entire room of people doing this using automated tools and years of experience. We can also see from their activity that they only take a few hours break each day, possibly working in shifts to get the crypto turned into cash."" Elliptic's analysis tallies with ByBit, which says that 20% of the funds have now ""gone dark"", meaning it is unlikely to ever be recovered. The US and allies accuse the North Koreans of carrying out dozens of hacks in recent years to fund the regime's military and nuclear development. On 21 February the criminals hacked one of ByBit's suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address that 401,000 Ethereum crypto coins were being sent to. ByBit thought it was transferring the funds to its own digital wallet, but instead sent it all to the hackers. Ben Zhou, the CEO of ByBit, assured customers that none of their funds had been taken. The firm has since replenished the stolen coins with loans from investors, but is, in Zhou's words, ""waging war on Lazarus"". ByBit's Lazarus Bounty programme is encouraging members of the public to trace the stolen funds and get them frozen where possible. All crypto transactions are displayed on a public blockchain, so it's possible to track the money as it's moved around by the Lazarus Group. If the hackers try to use a mainstream crypto service to attempt to turn the coins into normal money like dollars, the crypto coins can be frozen by the company if they think they are linked to crime. So far 20 people have shared more than $4m in rewards for successfully identifying $40m of the stolen money and alerting crypto firms to block transfers. But experts are downbeat about the chances of the rest of the funds being recoverable, given the North Korean expertise in hacking and laundering the money. ""North Korea is a very closed system and closed economy so they created a successful industry for hacking and laundering and they don't care about the negative impression of cyber crime,"" Dr Dorit Dor from cyber security company Check Point said. Another problem is that not all crypto companies are as willing to help as others. Crypto exchange eXch is being accused by ByBit and others of not stopping the criminals cashing out. More than $90m has been successfully funnelled through this exchange. But over email the elusive owner of eXch - Johann Roberts - disputed that. He admits they didn't initially stop the funds, as his company is in a long-running dispute with ByBit, and he says his team wasn't sure the coins were definitely from the hack. He says he is now co-operating, but argues that mainstream companies that identify crypto customers are betraying the private and anonymous benefits of crypto currency. North Korea has never admitted being behind the Lazarus Group, but is thought to be the only country in the world using its hacking powers for financial gain. Previously the Lazarus Group hackers targeted banks, but have in the last five years specialised in attacking cryptocurrency companies. The industry is less well protected with fewer mechanisms in place to stop them laundering the funds. Recent hacks linked to North Korea include: In 2020, the US added North Koreans accused of being part of the Lazarus Group to its Cyber Most Wanted list. But the chances of the individuals ever being arrested are extremely slim unless they leave their country.",2025-03-10T01:11:47.202Z,Joe Tidy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gjjrzm54o,Migrant deported in chains: 'No-one will go to US illegally now',"Gurpreet Singh was handcuffed, his legs shackled and a chain tied around his waist. He was led on to the tarmac in Texas by US Border Patrol, towards a waiting C-17 military transport aircraft. It was 3 February and, after a months-long journey, he realised his dream of living in America was over. He was being deported back to India. ""It felt like the ground was slipping away from underneath my feet,"" he said. Gurpreet, 39, was one of thousands of Indians in recent years to have spent their life savings and crossed continents to enter the US illegally through its southern border, as they sought to escape an unemployment crisis back home. There are about 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US, the third largest group behind Mexicans and El Salvadoreans, according to the most recent figures from Pew Research in 2022. Now Gurpreet has become one of the first undocumented Indians to be sent home since President Donald Trump took office, with a promise to make mass deportations a priority. Gurpreet intended to make an asylum claim based on threats he said he had received in India, but - in line with an executive order from Trump to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings - he said he was removed without his case ever being considered. About 3,700 Indians were sent back on charter and commercial flights during President Biden's tenure, but recent images of detainees in chains under the Trump administration have sparked outrage in India. US Border Patrol released the images in an online video with a bombastic choral soundtrack and the warning: ""If you cross illegally, you will be removed."" ""We sat in handcuffs and shackles for more than 40 hours. Even women were bound the same way. Only the children were free,"" Gurpreet told the BBC back in India. ""We weren't allowed to stand up. If we wanted to use the toilet, we were escorted by US forces, and just one of our handcuffs was taken off."" Opposition parties protested in parliament, saying Indian deportees were given ""inhuman and degrading treatment"". ""There's a lot of talk about how Prime Minister Modi and Mr Trump are good friends. Then why did Mr Modi allow this?"" said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a key opposition leader. Gurpreet said: ""The Indian government should have said something on our behalf. They should have told the US to carry out the deportation the way it's been done before, without the handcuffs and chains."" An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said the government had raised these concerns with the US, and that as a result, on subsequent flights, women deportees were not handcuffed and shackled. But on the ground, the intimidating images and President Trump's rhetoric seem to be having the desired effect, at least in the immediate aftermath. ""No-one will try going to the US now through this illegal 'donkey' route while Trump is in power,"" said Gurpreet. In the longer term, this could depend on whether there are continued deportations, but for now many of the Indian people-smugglers, locally called ""agents"", have gone into hiding, fearing raids against them by Indian police. Gurpreet said Indian authorities demanded the number of the agent he had used when he landed back home, but the smuggler could no longer be reached. ""I don't blame them, though. We were thirsty and went to the well. They didn't come to us,"" said Gurpreet. While the official headline figure puts the unemployment rate at only 3.2%, it conceals a more precarious picture for many Indians. Only 22% of workers have regular salaries, the majority are self-employed and nearly a fifth are ""unpaid helpers"", including women working in family businesses. ""We leave India only because we are compelled to. If I got a job which paid me even 30,000 rupees (£270/$340) a month, my family would get by. I would never have thought of leaving,"" said Gurpreet, who has a wife, a mother and an 18-month-old baby to look after. ""You can say whatever you want about the economy on paper, but you need to see the reality on the ground. There are no opportunities here for us to work or run a business.""  Gupreet's trucking company was among the cash-dependent small businesses that were badly hit when the Indian government withdrew 86% of the currency in circulation with four hours notice. He said he didn't get paid by his clients, and had no money to keep the business afloat. Another small business he set up, managing logistics for other companies, also failed because of the Covid lockdown, he said. He said he tried to get visas to go to Canada and the UK, but his applications were rejected. Then he took all his savings, sold a plot of land he owned, and borrowed money from relatives to put together 4 million rupees ($45,000/£36,000) to pay a smuggler to organise his journey, Gurpreet told us. On 28 August 2024, he flew from India to Guyana in South America to start an arduous journey to the US. Gurpreet pointed out all the stops he made on a map on his phone. From Guyana he travelled through Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia, mostly by buses and cars, partly by boat, and briefly on a plane - handed from one people-smuggler to another, detained and released by authorities a few times along the way. From Colombia, smugglers tried to get him a flight to Mexico, so he could avoid crossing the dreaded Darién Gap. But Colombian immigration didn't allow him to board the flight, so he had to make a dangerous trek through the jungle. A dense expanse of rainforest between Colombia and Panama, the Darién Gap can only be crossed on foot, risking accidents, disease and attacks by criminal gangs. Last year, 50 people died making the crossing. ""I was not scared. I've been a sportsman so I thought I would be OK. But it was the toughest section,"" said Gurpreet. ""We walked for five days through jungles and rivers. In many parts, while wading through the river, the water came up to my chest."" Each group was accompanied by a smuggler - or a ""donker"" as Gurpreet and other migrants refer to them, a word seemingly derived from the term ""donkey route"" used for illegal migration journeys. At night they would pitch tents in the jungle, eat a bit of food they were carrying and try to rest. ""It was raining all the days we were there. We were drenched to our bones,"" he said. They were guided over three mountains in their first two days. After that, he said they had to follow a route marked out in blue plastic bags tied to trees by the smugglers. ""My feet had begun to feel like lead. My toenails were cracked, and the palms of my hands were peeled off and had thorns in them. Still, we were lucky we didn't encounter any robbers."" When they reached Panama, Gurpreet said he and about 150 others were detained by border officials in a cramped jail-like centre. After 20 days, they were released, he said, and from there it took him more than a month to reach Mexico, passing through Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. Gurpreet said they waited for nearly a month in Mexico until there was an opportunity to cross the border into the US near San Diego. ""We didn't scale a wall. There is a mountain near it which we climbed over. And there's a razor wire which the donker cut through,"" he said. Gurpreet entered the US on 15 January, five days before President Trump took office - believing that he had made it just in time, before the borders became impenetrable and rules became tighter. Once in San Diego, he surrendered to US Border Patrol, and was then detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). During the Biden administration, illegal or undocumented migrants would appear before an immigration officer who would do a preliminary interview to determine if each person had a case for asylum. While a majority of Indians migrated out of economic necessity, some also left fearing persecution because of their religious or social backgrounds, or their sexual orientation. If they cleared the interview, they were released, pending a decision on granting asylum from an immigration judge. The process would often take years, but they were allowed to remain in the US in the meantime. This is what Gurpreet thought would happen to him. He had planned to find work at a grocery store and then to get into trucking, a business he is familiar with. Instead, less than three weeks after he entered the US, he found himself being led towards that C-17 plane and going back to where he started. In their small house in Sultanpur Lodhi, a city in the northern state of Punjab, Gurpreet is now trying to find work to repay the money he owes, and fend for his family.

The two women - an Israeli tourist and an Indian homestay operator - were stargazing with three male tourists near a lake in the city of Hampi, Karnataka, when they were attacked by a group of men on Thursday night, police superintendent Ram Arasiddi told Reuters. Arasiddi said the assailants pushed the men into the Tungabhadra River canal before raping the women. Two of the men, one of them American, survived, and the third man's body was recovered on Saturday morning, he said. ""Five people - two women and three men - were attacked near Sanapur,"" Arasiddi said. ""Two of them are foreigners, an American [man], and another a woman from Israel."" Police have arrested two of the men accused of the attack and an investigation is ongoing, Arasiddi said. Police believe the men followed the group. The US State Department said it was ""aware of reports that a US citizen was among a group of victims of violent crime"" near Hampi. According to witness testimony from one of the women, the group was stargazing near a temple in Sanapur when three men arrived on a motorcycle and asked them where they could get petrol. As one member of the group gave them directions, one of the three men demanded 100 rupees ($1.29) from the tourists. ""Since the homestay operator did not know them, she told them they had no money,"" police said. ""When the men repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees. ""After that, the three men allegedly started arguing."" The body of one of the male tourists was later found in the Tungabhadra canal in Karnataka's Koppal district. A case has been registered at Gangavathi Rural Police Station under sections related to extortion, robbery, gang rape and attempted murder. The victims are receiving medical treatment at a government hospital, the police said. Hampi, an ancient village in the south Indian state of Karnataka, is home to numerous ruins and temples from the Vijayanagara Empire. It was declared as a World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1986. In a post on X, Chief Minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah wrote: ""The attack and rape of an Israeli citizen and homestay owner is a most heinous act.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c757qk1lnq4o,Myanmar's military government says it will hold elections in next year,"The head of Myanmar's military government has said the country will hold a national election in December 2025 or January 2026. General Min Aung Hlaing said the elections would be ""free and fair"" - adding that 53 political parties had already submitted their lists to participate. It would be the first vote since his military junta seized power in a 2021 coup, arresting and imprisoning democratically elected leader Aung San Sung Kyi and making unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the previous year's elections. Since then, the country has been in turmoil, with a protest movement against the junta turning into an armed rebellion across the country. Critics have described the announcement as a sham designed to maintain the junta's power through proxy political parties. Human Rights Watch, an NGO, told the BBC: ""The junta is delusional if they think an election under the current circumstances will be considered remotely credible. ""As a precursor to elections, they need to end the violence, release all those arbitrarily detained, and allow all political parties to register and participate instead of dissolving opposition parties."" The military junta has carried out a violent crackdown on dissent since taking power, executing democracy activists and imprisoning journalists. But it has struggled to contain a widespread insurgency involving pro-democracy and ethnic rebel groups, and has limited control outside major cities. The UN, citing the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), said in January that at least 6,231 civilians have been killed by the military, including 1,144 women and 709 children, over the past four years. It warned in September that Myanmar was ""sinking into an abyss of human suffering"".",2025-03-08T15:48:39.044Z,Tom Bennett

Communities in southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW) were beginning the clean-up on Sunday after the storm caused widespread flooding and knocked down power lines and trees. A 61-year-old man's body was recovered from floodwaters on Saturday, while in a separate incident, 12 soldiers were taken to hospital after their convoy crashed en route to rescue operations. The storm had weakened by the time it made landfall near Brisbane on Saturday night, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday warned locals of the continued wild weather and risks from flooding. ""The situation in Queensland and northern New South Wales remains very serious due to flash flooding and heavy winds,"" Albanese said. ""Heavy rainfall, damaging wind gusts and coastal surf impacts are expected to continue over coming days."" Cyclone Alfred had hovered for days off the country's east coast as a category two cyclone before weakening into a tropical depression on Saturday. By Sunday evening, emergency services had conducted over a dozen rescues in Queensland and NSW - most involving people trapped by rising waters in their cars or homes. The NSW State Emergency Service reported receiving more than 6,000 calls for help. Almost 290,000 properties in the affected regions remain without power, and energy companies have warned residents the blackouts could persist for days.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrnyde158po,Summer is early - and India's economy is not ready for it,"A shorter winter has literally left Nitin Goel out in the cold. For 50 years, his family's clothing business in India's northwestern textile city of Ludhiana has made jackets, sweaters and sweatshirts. But with the early onset of summer this year, the company is staring at a washout season and having to shift gears. ""We've had to start making t-shirts instead of sweaters as the winter is getting shorter with each passing year. Our sales have halved in the last five years and are down a further 10% during this season,"" Goel told the BBC. ""The only recent exception to this was Covid, when temperatures dropped significantly."" Across India as cool weather beats a hasty retreat, anxieties are building up at farms and factories, with cropping patterns and business plans getting upended. Data from the Indian Meteorological Department shows that last month was India's hottest February in 125 years. The weekly average minimum temperature was also above normal by 1-3C in many parts of the country. Above-normal maximum temperatures and heatwaves are likely to persist over most parts of the country between March and May, the weather agency has warned. For small business owners like Goel, such erratic weather has meant much more than just slowing sales. His whole business model, practised and perfected over decades, has had to change. Goel's company supplies clothes to multi-brand outlets across India. And they are no longer paying him on delivery, he says, instead adopting a ""sale or return"" model where consignments not sold are returned to the company, entirely transferring the risk to the manufacturer. He has also had to offer bigger discounts and incentives to his clients this year. ""Big retailers haven't picked up goods despite confirmed orders,"" says Goel, adding that some small businesses in his town have had to shut shop as a result. Nearly 1,200 miles away in Devgad town on India's western coast, the heat has wreaked havoc on India's much-loved Alphonso mango orchards. ""Production this year would be only around 30% of the normal yield,"" said Vidyadhar Joshi, a farmer who owns 1,500 trees. The sweet, fleshy and richly aromatic Alphonso is a prized export from the region, but yields across the districts of Raigad, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri, where the variety is predominantly grown, are lower, according to Joshi. ""We might make losses this year,"" Joshi adds, because he has had to spend more than usual on irrigation and fertilisers in a bid to salvage the crop. According to him, many other farmers in the area were even sending labourers, who come from Nepal to work in the orchards, back home because there wasn't enough to do. Scorching heat is also threatening winter staples such as wheat, chickpea and rapeseed. While the country's agriculture minister has dismissed concerns about poor yields and predicted that India will have a bumper wheat harvest this year, independent experts are less hopeful. Heatwaves in 2022 lowered yields by 15-25% and ""similar trends could follow this year"", says Abhishek Jain of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (Ceew) think tank. India - the world's second largest wheat producer - will have to rely on expensive imports in the event of such disruptions. And its protracted ban on exports, announced in 2022, may continue for even longer. Economists are also worried about the impact of rising temperatures on availability of water for agriculture. Reservoir levels in northern India have already dropped to 28% of capacity, down from 37% last year, according to Ceew. This could affect fruit and vegetable yields and the dairy sector, which has already experienced a decline in milk production of up to 15% in some parts of the country. ""These things have the potential to push inflation up and reverse the 4% target that the central bank has been talking about,"" says Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist with Bank of Baroda. Food prices in India have recently begun to soften after remaining high for several months, leading to rate cuts after a prolonged pause. GDP in Asia's third largest economy has also been supported by accelerating rural consumption recently after hitting a seven-quarter low last year. Any setback to this farm-led recovery could affect overall growth, at a time when urban households have been cutting back and private investment hasn't picked up. Think tanks like Ceew say a range of urgent measures to mitigate the impact of recurrent heatwaves needs to be thought through, including better weather forecasting infrastructure, agriculture insurance and evolving cropping calendars with climate models to reduce risks and improve yields. As a primarily agrarian country, India is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Ceew estimates three out of every four Indian districts are ""extreme event hotspots"" and 40% exhibit what is called ""a swapping trend"" - which means traditionally flood-prone areas are witnessing more frequent and intense droughts and vice-versa. The country is expected to lose about 5.8% of daily working hours due to heat stress by 2030, according to one estimate. Climate Transparency, the advocacy group, had pegged India's potential income loss across services, manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors from labour capacity reduction due to extreme heat at $159bn in 2021- or 5.4% of its GDP. Without urgent action, India risks a future where heatwaves threaten both lives and economic stability.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg120gkryo,The 'traitor' at the heart of South Korea's impeachment drama,"Han Dong-Hoon was driving home from dinner in Seoul on December 3, scanning the radio, when he heard a breaking news update: President Yoon Suk-Yeol was preparing to deliver an emergency address. Han, then the leader of Yoon's People Power Party (PPP), was widely seen as one of the presiden't closest allies. Yet that was Han's first hint that Yoon was about to do something unprecedented. By midnight, the president had plunged the country into a political maelstrom, declaring martial law as part of a self-proclaimed bid to eliminate ""anti-state forces"" and North Korea sympathisers. ""When I first heard the news of martial law, I thought, 'We must stop it, because if it isn't lifted that very night, a bloodbath might occur,'"" Han tells BBC Korean. ""The fear and terror that South Korea's decades-long, hard-won achievements might suddenly collapse were overwhelming."" Soon after Yoon's announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader hosted a live stream urging people to assemble in protest outside the National Assembly building in central Seoul. Thousands responded, clashing with police and blocking military units as opposition lawmakers rushed into the assembly building, clambering over fences and walls in a desperate attempt to block Yoon's order. Han was among them. The late-night martial law edict seemed to have come from nowhere. It was, and remains, unclear who in Yoon's party supported or even knew of the move before it was made. But in the hours that followed, Han would help lead a successful attempt to overturn Yoon's order and have the declaration lifted. Weeks later, he would also play a key role in impeaching the disgraced president – a move that would see him branded a ""traitor"" by mainstream members of the PPP, and ultimately lead to his resignation as party leader. Han says he has ""no regrets"" about overturning Yoon's martial law attempt, insisting that he'd ""choose the same again"". But in many people's eyes, his subsequent decision to impeach the very president he'd helped get elected was a surprising heel turn for someone formerly viewed as Yoon's right-hand man. ""We have experienced so much together over many years,"" Han says of his relationship with Yoon. ""I find the current situation extremely painful and regretful. Both the president and I worked in good faith for the betterment of our country – yet I must say that I deeply regret how things have turned out."" For years, Han and Yoon were inseparable allies. Having both attended Seoul National University, the two forged a close bond as prosecutors while jointly investigating corruption in the country's halls of power. Han gained political prominence when Yoon was narrowly elected president in May 2022, after beating his opponent by less than 1% of the vote. Han was made Minister of Justice and later entrusted with the key role of Emergency Countermeasures Committee Chairman for the PPP, becoming the leader of the ruling party at the age of 50. Yoon's time in office was beleaguered by scandals and political failures – not least of all his landslide loss to the opposition Democratic Party last April. The result of those parliamentary elections was widely seen as a vote of no confidence against Yoon, and rendered him a lame-duck president. For most of Yoon's administration, the PPP's conservative base was enthusiastic about Han. The lawyer-turned-politician had quickly emerged as a likely party candidate for the next presidential election, originally scheduled for 2027. Now, as the increasing likelihood of a 2025 election looms amid the fallout of Yoon's ill-fated martial law attempt, Han's reputation is largely defined by the way he acted during and after that fateful night. While some still see him as a fresh and promising political figure, many view him as having betrayed the very president who had furthered his career. In the weeks following Yoon's abortive martial law order, the embattled president curried favour among PPP hardliners by refusing to cede political ground. While he apologised for the events of December 3, he refused to resign, instead holing up in his official residence in defiance of calls for his impeachment. He rallied his base and defended his decision by playing on unsubstantiated fears that the country was in danger. It was these staunch Yoon loyalists who would come to turn against Han. Despite having rejected Yoon's martial law declaration on December 3, Han initially opposed the impeachment motion put forth against the president by South Korea's political opposition – siding with almost every other PPP member in boycotting the first vote on December 7. Days later, Han changed course. This was after allegations had emerged that during the martial law attempt Yoon had ordered key political figures – including Han – to be arrested. In allegiance with his close political aides, Han threw his full support behind a second and ultimately successful impeachment attempt, ousting Yoon as president. ""I wanted nothing more than for this government to succeed,"" Han tells the BBC, reflecting on the storm of condemnation that then followed from within his own party ranks. ""I initially sought an orderly early resignation plan for the president – a plan I earnestly pursued, but which ultimately failed,"" he adds. ""I am deeply pained by the outcome and empathise with those who remain unconvinced and heartbroken. Nonetheless, I believe it was a necessary decision for South Korea's continued progress and development."" Yoon has been suspended from his presidential duties and is currently under investigation on insurrection charges. Han, meanwhile, stepped down as PPP leader in mid-December, maintaining that although Yoon's impeachment was painful, he did not regret his decision. In the two months that followed, Han says he took some time to ""quietly reflect"" on whether he could have done more during such a turbulent period for South Korea. ""And I wrote a book,"" he adds: a memoir, titled ""The People Come First"", which chronicles the two weeks following Yoon's martial law declaration. It's no surprise the book has become a bestseller: after all, it claims to be a first-hand account of events that have already gone down as some of the most dramatic in South Korea's political history. It hit shelves on 26 February, one day after the Constitutional Court held its final hearing on Yoon's impeachment trial. It also hints at Han's future ambitions. Publishing a memoir is seen as a common first step in launching a political campaign in South Korea, and some believe ""The People Come First"" underscores Han's hopes to run as the PPP's presidential candidate, if the court impeaches Yoon and triggers a snap election. Within the book's 384 pages, Han also discusses the need for constitutional reform and suggests that if he were to become president, he would change South Korea's five-year presidential term to four years. Should he choose to run, the memoir serves to remind South Koreans where he stands on crucial issues - and that he is no longer an ally of a disgraced president. As it stands, the odds look stacked against him. A recent poll found that Han's approval rating to become the next president sat at 6% – a fraction of the 22% rating he scored in January 2024. The decline of his political fortunes is compounded by the critics within the PPP, who accuse him of failing to protect both his former party and the president. But Han plays down the suggestion that his memoir is intended as a political tool. ""I have published a book in which I truthfully express what I experienced and thought during these events,"" he tells the BBC. ""I am not returning with any specific political manoeuvre, but simply to share that message with you all."" Another message Han seems eager to share is one of contrition towards the people of South Korea. He doesn't regret voting to impeach his president and former ally, he insists, but he does regret this. ""Yoon did impose martial law, and I believe that was a wrong act – one that does not align with the principles of liberal democracy,"" he says. ""As the leader of the ruling party that put that president in office, I want to express my deepest apologies to the people."" ""I am truly sorry that our actions, and the reactions we displayed, hurt the people. I think we must overcome and resolve this crisis.""",2025-03-07T04:08:46.462Z,Richard Kim
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj67yj1kj36o,"Students now free to choose their hairstyles, Thai court rules","After years of wrangling with authorities, students in Thailand can now let their hair down. Literally. On Wednesday, Thailand's Supreme Administrative Court annulled a 50-year-old directive by the education ministry, which had previously set out rules on hairstyles for school students: short hair for boys and ear-length bobs for girls. In practice, hairstyle rules have been gradually relaxed across many schools. But some still used the 1975 junta-issued directive as a guideline, and would cut the hair of students who didn't adhere. The 1975 directive violated individual freedoms protected by the constitution and was out of touch with today's society, the court said. The court decision this week came in response to a petition, filed by 23 public school students in 2020, which argued that the 1975 directive was unconstitutional. Student activists have long campaigned for hairstyle rules to be relaxed, saying it infringes on their human dignity and personal freedom over their bodies. One of them is Panthin Adulthananusak, who recently graduated from university. ""In the eyes of kids like us back then… even though it seemed impossible, we wanted to do something,"" he told the BBC. ""If no student in Thai history rose up to challenge the power of the adults that suppressed us, it would be a lifelong embarrassment."" In response to such campaigns, the education ministry in 2020 allowed students to have longer hairstyles - but there remained some restrictions. Boys' hair could not cover the nape of their necks, while girls with long hair had to tie it up. Those regulations were revoked in 2023, with then education minister Trinuch Thienthong announcing that students, parents and school authorities should negotiate their own common ground on what is acceptable for hairstyles in their schools. But through all these changes, some schools continued to follow the standard laid out in the original 1975 directive. Schools have traditionally associated short hair with discipline and tidiness - an argument that has been repeated by many social media users this week. But in recent years reports of schools banning bangs or dyed hair have sparked public outcry across Thailand. In some parts of the country, teachers are known to shoddily cut students' hair during morning assembly to punish them for flouting hairstyle rules. Such practices have continued even as education authorities warned teachers against it. In January, the Ministry of Education reiterated that it had repealed restrictions on hair length for all students, saying it recognised the ""importance of promoting diversity and fairness in all aspects of education"". Wednesday's court decision, which also says that schools' hairstyle rules should consider the freedom and dignity of students, reaffirms the official push to leave hair choices up to students themselves. But Panthin said the revoking of the decades-old directive ""still leaves a hole for schools to set their own rules"". In cases where schools have more conservative management, he suggested, restrictions could remain in place. Nonetheless, Panthin said he ""felt glad that what I had seen and fought all along was acknowledged and there was a tangible progress"". ""I hope this court's ruling will set a new standard for the understanding about basic human rights at the school.""",2025-03-07T07:50:59.800Z,Koh Ewe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddyyyl4rm5o,The Indian film showing the bride's 'humiliation' in arranged marriage,"It is often said that marriages are made in heaven. But in India, where a majority of marriages are arranged, the process of match-making can feel like a passage through hell for a woman and her family. That's the premise of Sthal: A Match, the 2023 gritty Marathi-language film that has won several prestigious awards at festivals in India and abroad. It is releasing for the first time in theatres in India on Friday. Set in rural Maharashtra state, the film centres around Savita, a young woman striving for an education and a career in a patriarchal society, and the attempts by her father Daulatrao Wandhare - a poor cotton farmer - to find a good husband for his daughter. ""He wants a good price for his crop and a good match for his daughter,"" says director Jayant Digambar Somalkar. The film is notable for the unflinching way it portrays what its lead actress calls the ""very humiliating"" experience of many young women, unlike other Indian movies about arranged marriage. Sthal has also grabbed attention as its entire cast is made up of first-time actors chosen from the village where it is shot. Nandini Chikte, who plays Savita, has already won two awards for her brilliant performance. The film opens with a sequence where Savita is interviewing a prospective groom. Along with her female relatives and friends, she watches as the young man serves them drinks from a tray. They laugh when he, visibly nervous, fumbles during questioning. Rudely awakened from what turned out to be a dream, Savita is told to get ready as a group of men are coming to see her. In reality, the gender roles are completely reversed, and in a scene that's replayed several times in the nearly two-hour film, Savita's humiliation comes into sharp focus. The prospective groom and other men from his family are welcomed by Savita's father and male relatives. Guests are fed tea and snacks and once the introductions are done, Savita is called in. Dressed in a sari, with eyes downcast, she sits down on a wooden stool facing her interrogators. Questions come, thick and fast. What's your name? Full name? Mother's clan? Date of birth? Height? Education? Subject? Hobbies? Are you willing to work on the farm? The men step out, to hold a discussion. ""She's a bit dark. She had makeup on her face, but did you not see her elbow? That is her real colour,"" says one. ""She's also short,"" he goes on to add. Others nod in agreement. They leave, telling Daulatrao that they will respond in a few days to let him know their decision. According to her parents, ""this is the fourth or fifth time someone has come to see Savita"" - all the earlier meetings have ended in rejection, leading to heartbreak and despair. The scene rings true. In India, men often have a laundry list of attributes they want in their brides - a glance at the matrimonial columns in newspapers and match-making websites shows everyone wants tall, fair, beautiful brides. Savita's protestations - ""I don't want to get married, I first want to finish college and then take civil services exams and build a career"" - carry no weight in her rural community, where marriage is presented as the only goal worth having for a young woman. ""Marriage is given far too much importance in our society,"" Chikte told the BBC. ""Parents believe that once the daughter is married, they will become free of their responsibility. It's time to change that narrative."" She says she found it ""very humiliating"" that Savita was made to sit on a stool to be judged by all those men who discussed her skin colour, while there was no discussion about the prospective groom. ""I was only acting, but as the film progressed, I lived Savita's journey and I felt angry on her behalf. I felt insulted and disrespected."" The film also tackles the social evil that is dowry - the practice of the bride's family gifting cash, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family. Though it has been illegal for more than 60 years, dowries are still omnipresent in Indian weddings. Parents of girls are known to take out huge loans or even sell their land and house to meet dowry demands. Even that doesn't necessarily ensure a happy life for a bride as tens of thousands are killed every year by the groom or his family for bringing in insufficient dowries. In the film too, Daulatrao puts up a ""for sale"" sign on his land, even though farming is his only source of livelihood. Director Somalkar says the idea for his debut feature film is rooted in his own experience. Growing up with two sisters and five female cousins, he had witnessed the ritual far too many times when prospective grooms visited his home. ""As a child you don't question tradition,"" he says, adding that the turning point came in 2016 when he accompanied a male cousin to see a prospective bride. ""This was the first time I was on the other side. I felt a bit uncomfortable when the woman came out and sat on a stool and was asked questions. When we stepped out for a discussion, I felt the conversation about her height and skin colour was objectifying her."" When he discussed the issue with his fiancée at the time - who is now his wife - she encouraged him to explore it in his work. In a country where 90% of all marriages are still arranged by families, Sthal is not the first to tackle the subject on screen. IMDB has a list of nearly 30 films about arranged marriage made by Bollywood and regional film industries just in the past two decades. More recently, the wildly popular Netflix show Indian Matchmaking focused entirely on the process of finding the perfect partner. But, as Somalkar points out, ""weddings are hugely glamourised"" on screen. ""When we think of weddings in India, we think of the big fat wedding full of fun and glamour. We think of Hum Aapke Hain Koun,"" he says, referring to the 1990s Bollywood blockbuster that celebrates Indian wedding traditions. ""And the Netflix show only dealt with a certain class of people, the ones who are wealthy and educated and the women are able to exercise their choice. ""But the reality for a majority of Indians is very different and parents often have to go through hell to get their daughters married,"" he adds. His reason for making Sthal, he says, is to ""jolt society and audiences out of complacency. ""I want to start a debate and encourage people to think about a process that objectifies women who have very little freedom to choose between marriage and career,"" he says. ""I know one book or one film doesn't change society overnight, but it can be a start."" Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",2025-03-06T22:55:49.952Z,Geeta Pandey
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ernge8193o,Fifteen hurt after SK fighter jets drop bombs by accident,"Fifteen people in South Korea were injured, two of them seriously, after a pair of fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs in a civilian district on Thursday during a live-fire military exercise, local media reported. The incident involving the Air Force KF-16 aircraft, in the city of Pocheon near North Korea, was part of routine drills held by the South to maintain combat readiness against potential attacks from the North. South Korea's Air Force said that it was investigating the incident and apologised for the damage, adding it would provide compensation to those affected. While shells from live firing exercises sometimes land near civilian residences, they rarely cause injuries. According to local media reports, two people suffered fractures to their necks and shoulders. A 60-year-old who was driving when the explosion happened had shrapnel lodged in their neck, Yonhap reported. ""I was driving when I heard a 'bang',"" they said. ""When I woke up, I was in an ambulance."" ""Our KF-16 (fighter jet) abnormally dropped eight shells of MK-82 bombs. It landed outside of firing range,"" said Korea's Air Force in a statement to the BBC. The military said the pilot of one of the jets inputted the wrong coordinates by mistake, causing the bombs to drop in the civilian community. Investigators have yet to determine why the second jet dropped its bombs, the military said, adding all live-fire exercises will be suspended. One church building and houses were also damaged as a result of the incident. Images published on local media show a broken window of a building and damaged roof of the church. A local resident told Yonhap that he had been watching television at home when the explosion, which sounded ""like a thunderclap"", shook the house. The director of a nearby senior citizen care centre said that the building's windows shattered and one of their teachers was taken to hospital with injuries. While no seniors were hurt, they said, ""they were so frightened that we sent them all home"". Pocheon authorities told the BBC earlier on Thursday that residents had been evacuated while a bomb disposal team worked on safely disposing any unexploded bombs. But authorities later said they did not find any unexploded bombs at the scene, Yonhap reported. The defence ministry said the training on Thursday was related to a joint drill with US forces. South Korea and the US are set to run combined drills from March 10 to March 20 - the first since US president Donald Trump's return to the White House. This comes at a time when the two countries are increasingly wary of the growing alliance between North Korea and Russia. During another joint drill by South Korea and the US in 2022, troops fired a short-range ballistic missile which malfunctioned and crashed on a golf course in the military base. While the warhead did not explode, it still burst into flames and sent panic rippling across residents in the area.",2025-03-06T07:12:09.536Z,"Jake Kwon, Hosu Lee & Koh Ewe"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry1yz9qevo,North Korea halts tourism just weeks after reopening,"North Korea has stopped tourists from visiting, just weeks after the first Western tourists entered the country for the first time in five years. North Korea sealed itself off at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020, and started to scale back restrictions in the middle of 2023. It opened up to Russian visitors in 2024, but it was only last month that Western tourists were allowed into the remote, eastern city Rason. However several tour companies now say that trips to the reclusive country have been cancelled until further notice. Pyongyang has not given a reason for the sudden halt. ""Just received news from our Korean partners that Rason is closed to everyone. We will keep you posted,"" China-based KTG Tours, which specialises in North Korean tours, said Wednesday on Facebook. Young Pioneer Tours and Koryo Tours were among the other agencies that have announced the suspension. Those planning tours in April and May should refrain from booking flights ""until we have more information"", Young Pioneer Tours said in a Facebook post. On 20 February, the first Western tourists started arriving in Rason, a city earmarked by the North as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies. Tour operators told the BBC the visitors' movements were even more restricted than on pre-pandemic trips - they had fewer opportunities to wander the streets and talk to locals. Phone signals and internet access were also not available in the hermit state. One tour leader said he suspects Rason was picked because the area is relatively contained and easy to control. Earlier this week, Koryo Tours said it was accepting international applications for the Pyongyang Marathon for the first time in five years. The event is scheduled for 6 April but it is now unclear if these can still be processed. North Korea saw some 350,000 foreign tourists in 2019, of whom 90% were Chinese, according to media reports.",2025-03-06T05:24:44.621Z,Jean Mackenzie
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdn0zq7n0zo,India's rap rebel makes a comeback after battling addiction,"About 15 years ago, an Indian rapper of humble origins broke onto the country's then-infertile hip-hop music scene and transformed it forever. He teased, cajoled and vexed his listeners, daring them to explore the ""devilish"" contours of his mind, as he sang rash rhymes about parties, drugs and ""seducing"" women. His songs played in clubs and weddings, blaring from stereos at big parties and roadside tea stalls alike. Then, at the peak of his career, he vanished. Seven years later, Yo Yo Honey Singh is back - with a new album and an ongoing music tour, claiming to be a changed man after a prolonged battle with drug abuse and mental health struggles. The 41-year-old singer and producer was once one of India's biggest music stars, a figure who ""moved the cultural gravity of hip-hop music"", says music journalist Bhanuj Kappal in Famous, a recent Netflix documentary on Singh. But he was also deeply controversial - and, by his own admission, an ""aggressive and reckless man"", routinely accused of promoting vulgarity, debauchery and violence through his music. Many criticised Singh's lyrics for depicting violence against women and rape, an image that gained further traction in the press after his former wife and childhood sweetheart accused him of domestic violence in her divorce filing. Singh has denied the charge. Seven years later, the singer is no longer the defiant hitmaker who once ruled the charts with his provocative, foot-tapping anthems. A lot has changed in the intervening years, including Indian hip-hop, which has evolved into a thriving, dynamic space. Artists once inspired by his sound have now surpassed him as the genre's leading voices. Singh also seems different. From someone who described himself as ""the all-knowing master of the universe"", he now identifies as a God-fearing man who believes in good energies, the cyclic nature of life and ""scientific astrologers"". He claims his music is now more conscious, moving beyond drugs to something deeper. But loyal fans say it's lost its edge and his latest tracks haven't left a mark. ""He has a core audience that will stick with him forever... but his vision is old now. It's outdated,"" Kappal says. But Singh is not ready to be written off, yet. Instead of trying to conceal or defend his personal struggles with fame and drugs, he has made it the centrepiece of his comeback. Since his return, Singh has candidly admitted his struggles with addiction and mental health. ""Drugs destroyed me completely,"" he told Lallantop, a digital news platform. ""I lost myself to fame, money and women. I was like a devil, completely satanic."" In interviews, he is witty and relaxed, speaking with the clarity of a tormented artist who, after battling his inner demons, seems to have unlocked a spiritual truth ""What goes around comes around, I really believe that,"" he said recently. ""It took a lot of time for me to get out from where I was stuck. But I am back now."" Born Hridesh Singh in Punjab state, he grew up in a cramped Delhi neighbourhood. Those tough early years shaped his music and still echo in his work today. ""This ghetto was my home, my hood, always will be,"" he's often heard saying. Singh always knew he wanted a career in music. He started as a college DJ, later moving into production full-time. ""I wanted to make beats and produce music, not sing or write,"" he says. But after years as a small-time producer in Punjab, he realised it wouldn't be enough. ""My sounds were too urban for the place. People didn't understand it. For that, I had to go beyond the state."" So he went solo. In 2011, Singh released The International Villager, his breakout album. Blending Punjabi folk - its dhol beats and string melodies - with global hip-hop, he created something entirely new. For three months, it seemed the formula had failed. Then everything changed. Overnight, the songs went viral, topped charts, won awards - and catapulted Singh into Bollywood. Brown Rang, a song about a brown man's global ambition, became YouTube's most-watched video in 2012. Shot in Dubai on a million-dollar budget, it introduced many Indians to the bling of hip-hop - fast cars, baggy clothes, gem-studded watches and gold chains - set to slick, thumping beats. Despite mounting criticism over his misogynistic lyrics, Singh packed stadiums and churned out hits, breaking into Bollywood with songs for stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar. ""A lot of times, my lyrics were trash, even I knew that. But people were still listening to it because the sound was so good and fresh,"" he told Lallantop. But Singh's ascent to fame coincided with his personal downfall. ""I was drowning in drugs and alcohol, smoking 12-15 joints and downing bottles. I abandoned my family, lost control. This one time, I got so high I bit a friend on his stomach eight times,"" he told Lallantop. In 2017, Singh broke down mid-tour - a moment that shook him. He quit music and substances, returned to Delhi and began recovery with a global team of doctors and therapists. ""I told my family I was mentally unwell. I can't do anything till I get better."" Singh says he's been sober for seven years, except for the occasional beer. ""I have been to hell and back,"" he says in Famous. ""Even now, I wake up hazy because of the medicines."" Fans, however, appreciate Singh's raw honesty about his self-destructive tendencies - and his effort to overcome them. ""No-one's perfect. But at least Singh tries to be better. He may have left the scene briefly but his music never stopped playing,"" says Nandini Gupta, a Delhi-based student. Others see his transformation as performative, noting his new music remains problematic. ""Though toned down, he is still objectifying women and talking only about money and fame,"" says listener Bushra Neyazi. No matter how you see it, Singh's redemption feels like another challenge to his audience - pushing them to accept his complicated past and give his music another chance. ""I was away for seven years, but I will drive everyone mad again in the next seven,"" he said recently. ""I am back and I want the same love I received seven years ago.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlye6yvrgzo,Who's doing the dishes? Bollywood film and government data have the same answer,"A new Bollywood film - Mrs - has once again laid bare a stark reality: even in well-educated households in India a woman's role is often confined to unpaid domestic work. The protagonist, married to a gynaecologist, finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning and caregiving. Her dreams are sidelined not by force, but by relentless criticism and quiet coercion. While the film, which is a remake of the hit Malayalam movie The Great Indian Kitchen, has sparked conversation - and pushback, especially from men on social media - its themes resonate with hard data. A recent government survey reveals that Indian women spend over seven hours a day on unpaid domestic and caregiving work - more than twice the time men do. Data shows that women spend 289 minutes on unpaid domestic work and 137 minutes on unpaid caregiving, whereas men spend 88 minutes on chores and 75 minutes on care work. They also spent less time than men doing paid work and engaging in self-care activities. What's disappointing is that the last such survey which came out six years ago had similar results. Despite the government launching campaigns to empower women, the situation hasn't changed much. India's Time Use Surveys (TUS) track how people spend their time across various activities. Surveyors gather data nationwide by asking individuals aged six to 59 how they spent the previous day. The first TUS was released in 2019, with the second published last week. When the government released findings from the second Time Use Survey (TUS), it highlighted two key shifts: women aged 15 to 59 spent 10 minutes less on unpaid domestic work, while their participation in employment and related activities rose by just over three percentage points. The survey concluded this marked a ""shift from unpaid to paid activities"" for women - a positive sign that they were spending less time on domestic chores and more time in paid employment. However, economists argue this isn't necessarily true. Even if it is, the slight drop in domestic work suggests women are still juggling paid jobs with a heavier load of unpaid work than men. Ashwini Deshpande, an economics professor at Ashoka University, says TUS data should be analysed alongside India's Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) for a deeper understanding of how women spend their time. FLFPR measures the percentage of women aged 15 and above in the labour force. According to government data, the FLFPR grew from about 23% in 2017-2018 to 37% in 2022-2023. Prof Deshpande says that this increase is not solely due to an increase in employment opportunities for women, but has also been spurred by economic distress. ""Women are not waiting for their time spent on domestic chores to reduce to take up jobs. Research shows that women want to work to supplement household incomes and so they end up working 'double-shifts', doing paid work outside the home and unpaid work inside,"" Prof Deshpande says. Indian women aren't alone in shouldering a disproportionate share of household and caregiving work - it's a global reality. However, the gap in time spent on domestic work is significantly wider in India. Where globally women spend about 2.8 hours more than men on domestic and care work, for Indian women, this difference is closer to four hours. Sociologists attribute this to India's deeply patriarchal society, which continues to enforce strict gender norms. Even among the educated elite, women remain confined by roles upheld and perpetuated not just by men, but also by women. This rigid enforcement of gender roles doesn't just shape women's lives - it also shapes the way stories about them are received. So, while Mrs struck a chord with many, it also faced sharp criticism - especially from men on social media. A men's rights group accused it of ""spreading toxicity"" against traditional joint families, while others dismissed its premise altogether. Kajol Srinivasan, a Mumbai-based comedian, says the film ruffled feathers because it held up an uncomfortable mirror to society. She told the BBC how her father, who quit his job at 40 to take over household duties while her mother continued working, quickly realised that housework was no easy task. ""The first week he was excited; he cooked different dishes and deep-cleaned the house,"" she says. But then he began to find the work tedious and couldn't continue beyond a week. ""My father realised that housework was not just about work, it was also an imbalance in power. The power always stays with the breadwinner; no matter how well you cook, there are no accolades,"" she says. She believes that women are expected and raised to accept this lower rung of power. ""When Indian men talk about what they like about their wives and mothers, it often has a lot to do with how much they have sacrificed for them or how much they take care of them or the home,"" Ms Srinivasan says. India's Time Use Survey shows that social change is slow, and it may take time before women spend less on domestic work. In the meantime, films like Mrs spark conversations around everyday questions many prefer to avoid - like, who's doing the dishes?",2025-03-08T00:27:37.264Z,Cherylann Mollan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7vlezv05no,Boom to gloom: India middle-class jitters amid trillion-dollar market rout,"Two years ago, on his bank adviser's suggestion, Rajesh Kumar pulled out his savings - fixed deposits included - and shifted to mutual funds, stocks and bonds. With India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five. But the tide has turned. For six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge. India's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third. ""For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market,"" Mr Kumar says. Mr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; £16,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. ""Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank,"" he says. His anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution. The go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media ""finfluencers"" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike. Meet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor. When his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market. ""I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!"" For now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. ""I'm both ignorant and confident,"" he says with wry candour. ""Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype."" Mr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. ""The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains,"" he says. In his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. ""When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed."" Mr Sircar lives in hope. ""My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green."" There are others who have taken more risks and already lost money. Lured by get-rich-quick videos, Ramesh (name changed), an accounting clerk from a small industrial town in western India, borrowed money to invest in stocks during the pandemic. Hooked to YouTube influencers, he dived into risky penny stocks and trading in derivatives. This month, after losing over $1,800 - more than his annual salary - he shut his brokerage account and swore off the market. ""I borrowed this money, and now creditors are after me,"" he says. Ramesh is one of 11 million Indians who lost a combined $20bn in futures and options trades before regulators stepped in. ""This crash is unlike the one during the Covid pandemic,"" says financial adviser Samir Doshi. ""Back then, we had a clear path to recovery with vaccines on the horizon. But with the Trump factor in play, uncertainty looms - we simply don't know what's next."" Fuelled by digital platforms, low-cost brokerages and government-driven financial inclusion, investing has become more accessible - smartphones and user-friendly apps have simplified market participation, drawing a broader, younger audience seeking alternatives to traditional assets. On the flip side, many new Indian investors need a reality check. ""The stock market isn't a gambling den - you must manage expectations,"" says Monika Halan, author and financial educator. ""Invest in equity only what you won't need for at least seven years. If you're taking on risk, understand the downside: How much could I lose? Can I afford that loss?"" This market crash couldn't have hit India's middle class at a worse time. Economic growth is slowing, wages remain stagnant, private investment has been sluggish for years and job creation isn't keeping pace. Amid these challenges, many new investors, lured by rising markets, are now grappling with unexpected losses. ""In normal times, savers can take short-term setbacks, because they have steady incomes, which keep adding to their savings,"" noted Aunindyo Chakravarty, a financial analyst. ""Now, we are in the midst of a massive economic crisis for the middle-class. On the one side, white-collar job opportunities are reducing, and raises are low. On the other, the real inflation faced by middle-class households - as opposed to the average retail inflation that the government compiles - is at its highest in recent memory. A stock market correction at such a time is disastrous for middle-class household finances."" Financial advisers like Jaideep Marathe believe that some people will start taking money out of the market and move them to safer bank deposits if the volatility continues for another six to eight months. ""We are spending a lot of time telling clients not to liquidate their portfolios and to treat this as a cyclical event."" But clearly, all hope is not lost - most believe that the market is correcting itself from previous highs. Foreign investor selling has eased since February, suggesting the market downturn may be nearing its end, says veteran market expert Ajay Bagga. Following the correction, valuations for many stock market indices have dipped below their 10-year average, providing some respite. Mr Bagga expects GDP and corporate earnings to improve, aided by a $12bn income-tax giveaway in the federal budget and falling interest rates. However, geopolitical risks - Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, and Trump's tariff plans - will keep investors cautious. In the end, the market meltdown might serve as a hard lesson for new investors. ""This correction is a much-needed wake-up call for those who entered the market just three years ago, enjoying 25% returns - that's not normal,"" says Ms Halan. ""If you don't understand markets, stick to bank deposits and gold. At least you have control.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkn28dpl4no,Can Tesla's EVs win over India's price-conscious buyers?,"After years of speculation, Tesla could finally be making its India debut. The American electric vehicle (EV) giant has begun hiring for a dozen jobs in Delhi and Mumbai. It is also reportedly hunting for showrooms in both cities. Asia's third largest economy offers an interesting growth opportunity for Tesla's futuristic cars as its global EV sales plummet and competition from Chinese manufacturers gets more intense. But there's a million-dollar question - can Tesla compete in India's price-sensitive market? Tata Motors currently holds pole position in India's EV market - with over 60% market share. MG Motors - jointly owned by India's JSW and a Chinese firm - is second at 22%. They are followed by Mahindra and Mahindra. EVs made by these companies cost less than half of what consumers will have to shell out - around $40,000 (£31,637) - for just the base model of Tesla. It will, therefore, be seen as a luxury car, competing with higher-end EVs made by Hyundai, BMW and Mercedes. Simply in volume terms, this will make India a tiny market for Tesla chief Elon Musk, unless the company introduces a low-cost model specifically for the country. Besides price, India's road conditions could pose a challenge. Tesla cars have very low ground clearance - or the distance between the lowest point of the car's undercarriage and the ground. This will make adapting to Indian roads difficult. To operate in the country, existing models may have to be re-engineered - which would drive up manufacturing costs. Will Tesla do this just for one developing market where it could have only a small presence? ""It's been a challenge even with other global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) at the high end with small volumes. You can't justify these major engineering changes,"" Hormazd Sorabjee, editor of Autocar India magazine, told the BBC. Also, amidst all the hype, it is easy to forget that EV sales still make up less than 3% of overall passenger vehicle sales in India. Even critical ancillary infrastructure, like charging stations, have taken years to come up. While they have picked up pace, there are only around 25,000 charging stations across India. In effect, Tesla will be jostling for space in a very small, albeit growing, EV market. But at a policy level, India appears to be making every effort to woo the carmaker. The country has outlined an ambitious national vision to go electric. It plans to have 30% of private cars, 70% of commercial cars, 40% of buses and 80% of two and three-wheelers go electric by 2030. Most provincial governments have also established their own EV policies to incentivise demand and supply. Subsidies offered by India on electric cars are also the highest among major economies, according to HSBC Securities. They amount to as much as 46% of the price of the country's top-selling electric car model. It's no surprise then that passenger EV sales have grown astronomically by over 2,000% in less than five years - going from a low base of 4,700 annually to a 100,000 cars. ""The price difference between regular cars and EVs has reduced a lot, making customers rethink their choice,"" says Jyoti Gulia, founder of JMK Research. In April last year, India also cut import taxes on EVs for global carmakers which committed to investing $500m (£400m) and starting local production within three years. Tesla and other imported electric vehicles costing over $35,000 (£27,550) can now enjoy a lower import duty of 15% on up to 8,000 vehicles. This came after Musk complained that high import duties had prevented the firm from launching its cars in the world's fastest-growing major economy. ""It's quite clever, as it forces a global player to localise - which is the way the game works: come and build in India,"" says Sorabjee. The proposed policy could put Indian domestic carmakers at a disadvantage, however, given that the investment requirement for foreign players is ""not significant"" compared to Indian players in this segment, an HSBC research paper warns. Import duty of 15% is also ""much lower"" than the tax on comparable combustion engine cars in India which also pay an additional road tax, according to HSBC. Domestic EV players say having a ""level playing field"" is important, but appear unperturbed by Tesla's impending entry for now. ""We welcome competition,"" Rajesh Jejurikar, Mahindra and Mahindra's Executive Director and CEO, told the BBC. His company feels that more players will strengthen India's existing EV ecosystem and is working to improve the appeal of their offerings. Critical issues like ""range anxiety"" - the worry whether an EV's battery charge will be enough to complete a journey - have been addressed through ""robust battery integration and rigorous real-world testing across diverse road conditions"", says Mr Jejurikar, adding that the brand is deploying cutting-edge technology into their product. It will be hard to beat Tesla's edge in this area though, and coupled with sturdier batteries and a better user interface, it will certainly differentiate Tesla cars from others in the market, says Sorabjee. What might also give Tesla tailwind is the rising share of premium vehicles in the Indian auto market. As a global brand with a perceived ""cool quotient"", owning a Tesla will be a status symbol for the young, aspirational Indian population. But none of this - India's EV policy or the growing demand for premium cars among India's affluent - has yet led to a commitment from Tesla to put manufacturing dollars into an EV facility. For now, it appears the carmaker will only ship units from its factories abroad. When that changes will depend on a lot of things - how quickly India's affluent consumer base widens, and what tariff structures look like once India completes trade negotiations with the US. President Donald Trump has already voiced displeasure over Tesla potentially building a factory in India to avoid high tariffs. In an interview with Fox News recently, he said that this would be ""unfair"" to the US. Could Trump's 'America First' policy diminish Musk's appetite for starting manufacturing units in India then? The question is moot, but for now it does look like India will first get glitzy Tesla showrooms for its rich, rather than job-creating Tesla factories for its under-employed masses.",2025-03-04T22:14:23.576Z,Arunoday Mukharji
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg813zy096o,Vanuatu revokes citizenship of fugitive Indian ex-IPL cricket boss,"The prime minister of Vanuatu has ordered the cancellation of a passport issued by the island nation to fugitive Indian businessman Lalit Modi, who is wanted by Delhi in a corruption case. The order came three days after India confirmed that Mr Modi had got citizenship of Vanuatu, a string of more than 80 islands in the Pacific Ocean. Mr Modi, the former chief of the Indian Premier League (IPL), is wanted for allegedly rigging bids during his tenure as the head of the world's richest cricket tournament. Mr Modi, who has been living in the UK since 2010, has always denied the allegations. India has made several unsuccessful attempts to extradite him. On Friday, India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters that Mr Modi had applied to surrender his Indian passport in London. ""We are also given to understand that he has acquired citizenship of Vanuatu. We continue to pursue the case against him as required under law,"" Jaiswal had said. The news of Mr Modi becoming a Vanuatu citizen had made headlines in India, where he was once the face of the glamorous, cash-rich IPL tournament. He was a regular presence on the social scene, rubbing shoulders with Bollywood stars and India's elite. But on Monday, Vanuatu's Prime Minister Jotham Napat announced that his country had decided to cancel Mr Modi's citizenship. Napat said a Vanuatu passport was a ""privilege"" and that ""applicants must seek citizenship for legitimate reasons"". ""None of those legitimate reasons include attempting to avoid extradition, which the recent facts brought to light clearly indicate was Mr Modi's intention,"" a media release quoted Napat as saying. He said that background checks and Interpol screenings conducted during Mr Modi's application for a passport had shown no criminal convictions. But, he added, that in the past 24 hours, he had been made aware that Interpol had twice rejected India's requests to issue an alert notice on Mr Modi, citing a lack of ""substantive judicial evidence"". ""Any such alert would've triggered an automatic rejection of Mr Modi's citizenship application,"" the release added. The move is likely to bring relief to Indian authorities. Unlike the UK, Vanuatu does not have an extradition treaty with India. Extradition treaties allow repatriation of people accused of crimes between countries. A day earlier, Mr Modi wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that there were no cases pending against him in any court in India and accused the media of peddling ""fake news"" about him. Mr Modi was instrumental in founding the IPL in 2008, which has now become a multi-billion-dollar industry. The main accusations against Mr Modi relate to rigging bids during the auction of two team franchises in 2010. He was also accused of selling broadcasting and internet rights without authorisation. In 2013, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) banned Mr Modi from any involvement in cricket activities for life.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89ypkq72d0o,Thousands evacuated as Japan's biggest fire in decades continues to burn,"Japan has deployed more than 2,000 firefighters to battle the country's biggest forest fire in three decades. At least one person has died in the blaze, which has torched more than 5,200 acres around the northern Japanese city of Ofunato since Thursday, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA). Although January to March is typically Ofunato's driest season, the area saw less rainfall last month than any February in more than 20 years - recording just 2.5 millimetres, compared to the usual average of 41. About 4,600 people remain under government-issued evacuation orders as the fire continues to burn. Some 2,000 have already left the area to stay with friends or relatives, and more than 1,200 have evacuated to shelters, officials said. The fires are burning in a forest area of Iwate Prefecture, which is Japan's second largest prefecture and has the country's second-lowest population density. More than 80 buildings are estimated to have been damaged so far, although FDMA noted that details are still being assessed. ""Although it is inevitable that the fire will spread to some extent, we will take all possible measures to ensure there will be no impact on people's homes,"" Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in parliament. Thousands of firefighters from 14 prefectures, including Tokyo, have been dispatched to fight the fires. At least 16 helicopters are also being used, with images showing the aircraft dumping water onto the smouldering hills. Like many other countries, Japan in 2024 recorded its hottest year since records began. It is difficult to know if climate change has caused or worsened specific fires, because other factors - such as changes to the way land is used - are also relevant. However, the IPCC says climate change is making the weather conditions needed for wildfires to spread more likely. Have you been evacuated? Send us your story.",2025-03-03T12:07:30.431Z,Gavin Butler
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zvlgqzdpo,USAID cuts shutter India's first clinic for transgender people,"India's first medical clinic for transgender people has shut operations in three cities after US President Donald Trump stopped foreign aid to it. Mitr (friend) Clinic, which was started in 2021 in the southern city of Hyderabad, offered HIV treatment, support and counselling services to thousands of transgender people. Two more Mitr Clinics in Thane and Pune cities in western India, which were established the same year, have also shut down due to the aid cut. In January, Trump signed an executive order pausing all foreign aid for 90 days, pending a review. Trump has said he wants overseas spending to be closely aligned with his ""America First"" approach. His crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid to foreign countries since the 1960s, has been seen as a step to this end. The pausing of USAID funds has affected dozens of development programmes all around the world, especially in poor and developing countries. In India, the shutting down of the Mitr Clinics has impacted the transgender community's access to crucial medical support. The project came into existence under the US President's agency for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003 when George Bush was president. John Hopkins University worked in collaboration with USAID and the Indian government to set it up. A staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity to BBC Hindi said the three clinics catered to some 6,000 people and about 6% to 8% of the patients were being treated for HIV. ""All these cases were below 30 years of age. And 75% to 80% of this population was accessing health services for the first time,"" this staff member said. In Hyderabad, the Mitr Clinic offered care to 150 to 200 transgender patients each month, many of whom suffered from HIV. The clinic had a small team of doctors, psychologists and technical staff. ""We were receiving 250,000 rupees ($2900; £2300) every month to provide services,"" Rachana Mudraboyina, a trans woman who was in-charge of the clinic, told BBC Hindi. The news of the clinic's closure has come as a blow to the community. Vyjayanti Vasanta Mogli, a trans woman who has visited the clinic, told The Indian Express newspaper that she was ""devastated"" by the news as the clinic used to offer treatment at subsidised rates. Another trans woman, who was hoping to use the clinic's services, told the Express that she was sad that she would no longer be able to do this. India is estimated to have around two million transgender people, though activists say the number is higher. Despite a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that gives them the same rights as people of other genders, many still struggle to access education and healthcare due to stigma and discrimination. There are state-run and private hospitals that offer medical help to the community, but many say they prefer going to Mitr Clinics because they find it more affordable and inclusive. ""Transgender people are not treated properly in general hospitals,"" Rachana says, explaining why the Mitr Clinics were so important for the community. Trump's order freezing foreign aid has been criticised by many. ""USAID has made significant contributions in health and education and shutting it down is bound to have an impact on developing countries,"" Bubberjung Venkatesh, a lawyer, told BBC Hindi. ""It's a big blow. Its support for HIV prevention was significant,"" he added. Last Thursday, the Trump administration said it was going to eliminate more than 90% of USAID's foreign aid contracts. This means that very few projects will survive and the Mitr Clinics are unlikely to be among them. Elon Musk, a close aide of Trump who also heads a government department in charge of slashing federal spending and jobs, has criticised funding projects for transgender people. ""That's what American tax dollars were funding,"" Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday in response to a post about the closure of the Mitr Clinics. Meanwhile, staff at the clinic say they are looking for funding from other sources and hope that the state government will step in to help. ""We did a lot more than just provide medical help. The clinic also provided us a space to interact with the community, to share advice about various government schemes and health facilities,"" Rachana says. ""We want to continue [running the clinic] and are trying our best to find donors,"" she adds.",2025-03-03T10:54:53.030Z,Imran Qureshi
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8j0gm2de77o,Dozens found alive in metal containers after India avalanche,"Dozens of construction workers have been pulled out alive from metal containers after they were buried by an avalanche in the Himalayas in India's Uttarakhand state. They survived - some as long as nearly two days - as the containers in which they were living had enough oxygen to sustain them until rescuers could dig them out, Indian media reported quoting officials. On Friday, 54 workers were buried when the avalanche hit a construction camp near Mana village. Eight were killed, while the other 46 were rescued. The operation lasted almost 60 hours in sub-zero temperatures and concluded on Sunday. Most of the labourers, who were working on a highway expansion project, were able to ""withstand the wrecking avalanche"" because of the containers, rescuers told The Indian Express newspaper. ""These metal shelters saved most of them. They had just enough oxygen to hold on until we got them out,"" a senior rescue official told The Times of India. The newspaper reported that the force of the avalanche had hurled eight metal containers and a shed down the mountain. Uttarakhand state Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has thanked rescue teams for their efforts in challenging conditions. Members of the Indian army, national and state disaster response forces and local administration had worked to free the workers, using helicopters and drones for the operation. Many of the rescued workers are receiving treatment at hospitals in the state's Joshimath town and Rishikesh city. Satyaprakash Yadav, a migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh who was among those rescued, said the ""avalanche hit our container like a landslide"", according to a video released by the army. He added that the container he was in broke apart when the snow hit and it ended up near a river. ""We managed to get out on our own and reached a nearby army guest house, where we stayed overnight,"" he added. Rajnish Kumar, a worker from Uttarkhand's Pithoragarh town, said most of them were sleeping when the avalanche struck. ""When the snow hit the container, it sank about 50 to 60 metres down [the mountain]. The Army arrived quickly and rescued us,"" he said, according to the army video. Gaurav Kunwar, a former village council member of Mana, told the BBC on Friday the area where the avalanche hit was a ""migratory area"" and that it had no permanent residents. ""Only labourers working on border roads stay there in the winter,"" he said, adding that it had rained for two days prior to the avalanche. The India Meteorological Department has warned of rainfall and snow in the northern states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as well as Jammu and Kashmir until Tuesday. Avalanches and landslides are common in the higher regions of the Himalayas, especially during winter. Experts say that climate change has made extreme weather more severe and less predictable. There has also been a rapid rise in deforestation and construction in Uttarakhand's hilly areas in recent years. In 2021, nearly 100 people died in Uttarakhand after a piece of a Himalayan glacier fell into the river, triggering flash floods.

A rescue operation has been under way after the avalanche swept away road construction workers in the village of Mana, which shares a border with Tibet, on Friday. Some 50 people who were buried under snow and debris were rescued, but four died from their injuries, the Indian army said. Helicopters have been deployed in the search for five people who are still unaccounted for in the Himalayan mountain state, it added.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgee5ywq2vo,Threat to Kashmir's iconic chinar trees - and the fight to save them,"Was it pruning or felling? The alleged chopping of centuries-old chinar trees in Indian-administered Kashmir has sparked outrage, with locals and photos suggesting they were cut down, while the government insists it was just routine pruning. The debate has renewed focus on the endangered tree and efforts to preserve it. The chinar is an iconic symbol of the Kashmir valley's landscape and a major tourist draw, especially in autumn when the trees' leaves light up in fiery hues of flaming red to a warm auburn. The trees are native to Central Asia but were introduced to Kashmir centuries ago by Mughal emperors and princely kings. Over the years, they have come to occupy an important place in Kashmiri culture. But rapid urbanisation, illegal logging and climate change are threatening their survival, prompting authorities to take steps to conserve them. The Jammu and Kashmir government has been geotagging chinar trees in an effort to keep track of them and their health. The project involves attaching a QR code to each tree with information about its location, age and other physical characteristics. ""We are 'digitally protecting' chinar trees,"" says Syed Tariq, a scientist who's heading the project. He explains that information provided by the QR code can help locals and tourists get to known more about a tree, but it can also help counter problems like illegal or hasty cutting of them. The project has geotagged about 29,000 chinar trees so far, with another 6,000–7,000 still left to be mapped. Despite its heritage value, there was no proper count of these trees, says Mr Syed. While government records cite 40,000, he calls the figure debatable but is certain their numbers have declined. This is a problem because the tree takes at least 50 years to reach maturity. Environmentalists say new plantations are facing challenges like diminishing space. Additionally, chinar trees need a cool climate to survive, but the region has been experiencing warmer summers and snowless winters of late. But on the bright side, these trees can live for hundreds of years - the oldest chinar tree in the region is believed to be around 700 years old. A majority of the trees are at least a few centuries old and have massive trunks and sprawling canopies. The trees received maximum patronage during the Mughal period, which stretched from the early 1500s to the mid-1800s. Many of the trees that exist in the valley were planted during this period, Mr Syed says. The Mughal kings, who ruled many parts of erstwhile India, made Kashmir their summer getaway due to its cool climate and beautiful scenery. They also erected ""pleasure gardens"" - landscaped gardens famous for their symmetry and greenery - for their entertainment. The chinar enjoyed pride of place in these gardens and the trees were usually planted along water channels to enhance the beauty of the place. Many of these gardens exist even today. According to government literature, in the 16th Century Mughal emperor Akbar planted around 1,100 trees in one such pleasure garden near the famous Dal Lake in Srinagar, but about 400 have perished over the years due to road-widening projects and diseases caused by pests. Emperor Jahangir, Akbar's son, is said to have planted four chinar trees on a tiny island in Dal Lake, giving it the name Char Chinar (Four Chinars) - now a major tourist draw. Over time, two trees were lost to age and disease, until the government replaced them with transplanted mature trees in 2022. Interestingly, the chinar is protected under the Jammu and Kashmir Preservation of Specified Trees Act, 1969, which regulates its felling and export and requires official approval even for pruning. The law remains in force despite the region losing statehood in 2019. But environmental activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat says authorities often exploit legal loopholes to cut down chinar trees. ""Under the garb of pruning, entire trees are felled,"" he says, citing a recent alleged felling in Anantnag district that sparked outrage. ""The government is geotagging trees on one side, but cutting them on the other,"" he says. He adds that while authorities remove trees for urban projects, locals also fell them illegally. Chinar trees have durable hardwood, ideal for carvings, furniture and artefacts. Locals also use them for firewood and making herbal medicine. Government projects like geotagging are raising awareness, says Mr Bhat. He adds that Kashmiris, deeply attached to the chinar as part of their heritage, now speak out against its felling or damage. Last week, many posted photos of the allegedly chopped trees in Anantnag on X (formerly Twitter) while opposition leaders demanded that the government launch an investigation and take action against the culprits. ""The government should protect the trees in letter and in spirit,"" Mr Bhat says. ""Because without chinar, Kashmir won't feel like home.""",2025-03-01T01:23:29.574Z,Cherylann Mollan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jggdnej0do,First British tourists allowed back into North Korea tell BBC what they saw,"Don't insult the leaders. Don't insult the ideology. And don't judge. These are the rules tour guides read out to Western tourists as they prepare to drive across the border into North Korea, arguably the most secretive and repressive country in the world. Then there is the practical information. No phone signal, no internet, no cash machines. ""The North Koreans aren't robots. They have opinions, goals, and a sense of humour. And in our briefing we encourage people to listen to and understand them,"" says Rowan Beard, who runs Young Pioneer Tours, one of two Western companies which resumed trips to the country last week, after a five-year hiatus. North Korea sealed its borders at the outset of the pandemic, shutting out diplomats, aid workers and travellers, and making it nearly impossible to know what was happening there. Since then, it has further isolated itself from most of the world, relying on support from Russia and China. Many doubted whether Westerners would ever be allowed back. But after years of cajoling and several false starts, Rowan and some other tour leaders were given the green light to restart operations. He pulled together a group of eager travellers in just five hours, desperate to not miss the opportunity. Most were vloggers and travel addicts, some wanting to tick the final country off their list, along with the odd North Korea enthusiast. Last Thursday the tourists, from the UK, France, Germany and Australia, drove over the border from China into the remote area of Rason for a four-night trip. Among them was 28-year-old British YouTuber Mike O'Kennedy. Even with its reputation, he was startled by the extreme level of control. As with all trips to North Korea, the tourists were escorted by local guides, who followed a strict, pre-approved schedule. It included carefully choreographed trips to a beer factory, a school, and a new, fully stocked pharmacy. Ben Weston, one of the tour leaders from Suffolk, likened visiting North Korea to ""being on a school trip"". ""You can't leave the hotel without the guides,"" he said. ""A couple of times I even had to let them know when I wanted to use the bathroom,"" said Mike. ""I've never had to do that anywhere in the world."" Despite the chaperoning, Mike was able to spot snippets of real life. ""Everyone was working, it didn't feel like anyone was just hanging out. That was kind of bleak to see."" On his trip to the school, a group of eight-year-olds performed a dance to animations of ballistic missiles hitting targets. A video of the spectacle shows girls and boys with red neckties, singing, while explosions flare on a screen behind them. For now, tourists are being kept well away from the capital Pyongyang. Greg Vaczi from Koryo Tours, the other tour company allowed back in, admits the current itinerary lacks the ""big-hitting monuments"" of Pyongyang. He suspects authorities have chosen Rason as their guinea pig because the area is relatively contained and easy to control. Set up as a special economic zone, to trial new financial policies, it operates as a mini capitalist enclave inside an otherwise socialist state. Chinese businesspeople run joint enterprises with North Koreans, and can travel in and out fairly freely. Joe Smith, a seasoned North Korea traveller and former writer for the specialist North Korea platform NK News, was there on his third trip. ""I feel like the more times you visit the less you know. Each time you get a little peek behind the curtain, which just leaves you with more questions,"" he said. Joe's highlight was a surprise off-agenda visit to a luxury goods market, where people were selling jeans and perfumes, along with fake Louis Vuitton handbags and Japanese washing machines, probably imported from China. Here, the tourists were not allowed to take photos - an attempt to hide this consumer bubble from the rest of the country, they suspected. ""This was the only place people weren't expecting us,"" Joe said. ""It felt messy and real; a place North Koreans actually go. I loved it."" But according to the experienced tour leaders, the group's movements were more restricted than on previous trips, with fewer opportunities to wander the streets, pop into a barbershop or supermarket, and talk to locals. Covid was often cited as the reason, said Greg from Koryo Tours. ""On the surface they are still concerned. Our luggage was disinfected at the border, our temperatures were taken, and about 50% of people are still wearing masks."" Greg cannot work out whether the fear is genuine, or an excuse to control people. It is thought Covid hit North Korea hard, though it is difficult to know the extent of the suffering. Local guides repeated the government line that the virus entered the country in a balloon sent over from South Korea, and was swiftly eradicated in 90 days. But Rowan, who has been to North Korea more than 100 times, sensed that Rason had been impacted by the tough Covid regulations. A lot of Chinese businesses had closed, he said, and their workers had left. Even Joe, the experienced North Korea traveller, commented on how dilapidated the buildings were. ""Places were dimly lit and there was no heating, apart from in our hotel rooms,"" he said, noting a trip to a cold, dark and deserted art gallery. ""It felt like they opened the doors just for us."" The regime's photographs might make North Korea look clean and shiny, Joe said, but in person you realise ""the roads are awful, the pavements are wobbly, and the buildings are weirdly constructed"". His hotel room was old-fashioned and filthy, he said, resembling ""his grandma's living room"". The whole window was cracked. ""They've had five years to fix things. North Koreans are so sensitive about what they show tourists. If this is the best they can show, I dread to think what else is out there"", he said. Most of the country is kept well hidden, with more than four in 10 people believed to be undernourished and needing help. One of the few chances tourists in North Korea get to interact with local people is through their guides, who sometimes speak English. On these recent trips they were surprisingly well-informed, despite the regime's intense propaganda machine and information blockade. This is probably because they speak to the Chinese businesspeople who come and go, said Greg. They knew about Trump's tariffs and the war in Ukraine - even that North Korean troops were involved. But when Joe showed a photo from Syria, his guide was unaware President Assad had been toppled. ""I carefully explained that sometimes when people don't like their leader, they rise up and force them out, and at first he didn't believe me."" Such conversations need to be delicately handled. Strict laws prevent North Koreans from speaking freely. Ask or reveal too much and the tourists might put their guide or themselves at risk. Mike admits there were times this made him nervous. On a trip to a North Korea-Russia Friendship House, he was invited to write in the visitors' book. ""I went blank and wrote something like 'I wish the world peace.' Afterwards my guide told me that was an inappropriate thing to write. That made me paranoid,"" he said. ""Generally, the guides did a great job of making us feel safe. There were just a couple of moments when I thought, this is bizarre."" For Greg from Koryo Tours, these interactions bring a deeper purpose to North Korea tourism: ""North Koreans get the chance to engage with foreigners. This allows them to come up with new ideas, which, in a country this closed, is so important."" But tourism to North Korea is contentious, especially as travellers have been allowed back before aid workers and most Western diplomats, including the UK's. Critics, including Joanna Hosaniak from the Citizens Alliance for North Korean Human Rights, argue these trips mainly benefit the regime. ""This is not like tourism in other poor countries, where local people benefit from the extra income. The vast majority of the population don't know these tourists exist. Their money goes to the state and ultimately towards its military,"" she said. One conversation has stuck in YouTuber Mike's head. During his trip to the school, he was surprised when a girl, after meeting him, said she hoped to visit the UK one day. ""I didn't have the heart to tell her that her chances were very, very slim,"" he said.",2025-02-28T23:08:11.167Z,Jean Mackenzie
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr522g2lmmpo,Six killed in blast at Pakistan's 'University of Jihad',"At least six people have been killed in a suicide attack at an Islamic seminary in northern Pakistan that has been described as the ""University of Jihad"". The blast happened at the mosque within the Darul Uloom Haqqania, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 55km (34 miles) from the northern city of Peshawar. Maulana Hamid ul-Haq, a prominent cleric and the influential head of the school, is among the dead. Police said more than 10 other people had been injured. The seminary has long been associated with the Taliban since several of its members, including the group's founder Mullah Omar, trained there. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came ahead of the start of the holy month of Ramadan. The explosion occurred after Friday prayers, according to local police. Haq's son, Khuzaima Sami, told the BBC that hundreds were present in the main hall at the time of the blast and that he feared there would be many casualties. An investigation has been launched into the attack. ""Initial reports suggest the blast occurred after Friday prayers as people were gathering to greet Hamid ul-Haq,"" Abdul Rasheed, the district police chief, told the AFP news agency. The seminary - where clerics are taught - also known as a madrassa, is considered one of the region's most renowned religious educational institutions and is an important academic centre of the Deoband school of thought. It has been referred to as the ""University of Jihad"" due to its notable alumni, including Jalaluddin Haqqani, the founder of the militant Haqqani Network, and his son Sirajuddin Haqqani. Both men played key roles in leading the Taliban's insurgency, first against Soviet forces and later against US and Nato forces, in Afghanistan. Haq, 57, was the son of the influential Pakistani cleric Maulana Sami ul-Haq, widely known as the ""Father of the Taliban"". He became the seminary's vice-chancellor after his father's assassination in 2018, and the head of a faction of the religious Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-S) political party. He also served as a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan from 2002 to 2007. Haq's father had longstanding ties with the Afghan Taliban's leadership, including Mullah Omar. He was considered an influential figure in facilitating negotiations between the Taliban and the Pakistani government. Despite their strong connections with the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, neither Haq nor his father were directly involved in any anti-state movements. Instead, they were often seen as intermediaries between Pakistan and the Taliban. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif condemned the attack, as did the Pakistani Taliban. The group described Haq as a ""preacher of truth, a compassionate teacher, and a fearless advocate for the stability of madrassas"".",2025-02-28T17:50:06.512Z,Kathryn Armstrong & Sarah Atiq
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36wwld19gzo,Dozens missing in Indian Himalayas avalanche,"At least 25 road workers remain trapped after a massive avalanche struck a remote border area in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, officials say. Senior district official Sandeep Tiwari told BBC Hindi that 32 workers had been rescued and moved to an army camp nearby. The avalanche hit a Border Roads Organisation (BRO) camp in the village of Mana, which shares a border with Tibet, officials say. Officials said rescue operations were continuing in extreme weather amid heavy snowfall. Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami wrote on X that rescue work was being carried out by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the BRO and other teams. Ambulances and emergency teams have been dispatched, but treacherous conditions continue to pose challenges for rescuers. Footage posted on X by ITBP showed rescuers carrying people on stretchers and walking through several feet of snow - even as more snow continued to fall. Colonel Ankur Mahajan, a commander with the BRO, told the Hindustan Times newspaper that those who had been rescued were receiving treatment ""but the extent of their injuries is unclear"". Gaurav Kunwar, a former village council member of Mana, told BBC News that details of the incident were sketchy. ""No-one lives there permanently. It's a migratory area and only labourers working on border roads stay there in the winter. There's also some army presence there. We've heard that it has been raining in the area for two days. The road workers were in a camp when the avalanche hit."" Earlier on Friday, the India Meteorological Department warned of heavy rainfall and snow in the northern Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well as Jammu and Kashmir. Orange alerts have also been issued for snowfall in several districts of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.",2025-02-28T14:27:44.127Z,Nikhil Inamdar
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjev9kzxeqqo,Inside the Taliban's surveillance network monitoring millions,"In a crowded control centre, surrounded by dozens of TV screens, the Taliban's police force proudly shows off its newly-acquired network of 90,000 CCTV cameras - used to watch over the day-to-day lives of millions of people. ""We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,"" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens. The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law. The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action. Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul. From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored. ""In certain neighbourhoods, when we notice groups of people and suspect they might be involved in drug use, criminal activities, or something suspicious, we quickly reach out to the local police,"" says Zadran. ""They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering."" Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime. The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power. However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.  The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask. ""On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,"" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction. The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within. The interior ministry says the cameras have ""significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders"". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures. However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long. Amnesty International say installing cameras ""under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces"". By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment. In December, women training as midwives and nurses told the BBC they had been ordered not to return to classes. While women continue to be visible on the streets of cities like Kabul, they are required to wear a face covering. Fariba*, a young graduate who lives with her parents in Kabul, has been unable to find work since the Taliban came to power. She tells the BBC there is ""significant concern that surveillance cameras may be used to monitor women's hijabs [veils]"". The Taliban say only the city police have access to the CCTV system and the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry – the Taliban's morality police - does not use it. But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule. ""Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,"" she says. ""There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,"" she says. Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used. The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they ""are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge"". The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment. Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system. In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home. ""They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household,"" she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; £54) a month.  The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power. According to the United Nations, 30 million people are in need of aid. ""If families refused to pay [for the cameras], they were threatened with water and power cuts within three days,"" Shella adds. ""We had to take loans to cover the costs. ""People are starving - what good are these cameras to them?"" The Taliban say that if people do not want to contribute, they can put in an official complaint. ""Participation was voluntary, and donations were in the hundreds, not thousands,"" Khalid Zadran, the Taliban police spokesperson, insists. Despite the assurances, rights campaigners both inside and outside Afghanistan continue to have concerns over how such a powerful surveillance system will be used. Jaber, a vegetable seller in Kabul, says the cameras represent another way in which Afghans are made to feel powerless. ""We are treated like trash, denied the opportunity to earn a living, and the authorities regard us as worthless,"" he told the BBC. ""We can do nothing."" *The names of the women interviewed for this piece were changed for their safety With additional reporting by Peter Ball ",2025-02-27T00:59:13.405Z,Mahjooba Nowrouzi
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yr7j18edjo,"'I need help': Freed from Myanmar's scam centres, thousands are now stranded","""I swear to God I need help,"" said the man quietly on the other end of the line. The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand. They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border. But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow. The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people – more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough. The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten. He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could. Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills. Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses. ""It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people."" Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar. Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money. China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border. Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October. He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss. ""They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us."" Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well. He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls. The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border. It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business. That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds. The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community. Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border. Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home. A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled. The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok. The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses. Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people. Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business. ""If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it – we must work seriously,"" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers. ""Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,"" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres. ""We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough."" Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them. But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them. Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave. On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital. ""I just want to go home,"" he said over the phone. ""I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.""",2025-02-26T22:34:29.906Z,"Jonathan Head, Lulu Luo and Thanyarat Doksone"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e36jm4jro,Did Iron Age 'begin' in India? Tamil Nadu dig sparks debate,"For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past. Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce. Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC. Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953–3,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent. ""The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,"" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University. The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as ""Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?"" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure. Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions. He believes that iron technology likely emerged ""independently in multiple regions"". Also, the ""earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly"". If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, ""it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records"", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find ""suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world"". Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites. Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking. Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron. At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity. Some finds are particularly striking. Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th–15th Century BC. This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes. ""We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,"" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there ""were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time"". Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community. The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it. To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,"" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me. ""The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,"" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India. ""What's clear now,"" she adds, ""is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent."" Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, ""what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,"" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community. However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, ""Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu."" Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was ""just the starting point"". ""We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.""",2025-02-26T22:32:33.838Z,Soutik Biswas
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9yxjv8m4ko,Rape case filed against Domino's Pizza franchise owner in India,"Indian police have registered a case against leading businessman Shyam S Bhartia and three others for alleged criminal intimidation and rape of an aspiring Bollywood actress. Bhartia is the founder and chairman of Jubilant Bhartia Group. Its subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks is the largest franchisee for Domino's Pizza outside of the US. The woman, who can't be named under Indian law, accuses Bhartia of intoxicating and then ""brutally"" raping her in Singapore. Bhartia has denied the allegations as ""baseless, false and disparaging"" in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The company said Bhartia would fully cooperate with the investigation. Jubiliant FoodWorks has not responded separately to the BBC's request for comment. The woman said she first complained to the police on 11 November 2024. But her case was registered only on 22 February on orders of the Bombay High Court after it heard her petition. The petition and the police complaint seen by the BBC alleged that the woman first met Bhartia in 2022 at a five star hotel in Mumbai through a co-accused, who allegedly promised to introduce her to people who could help further her career in the entertainment industry. She alleges that Bhartia agreed to invest in her film project and asked her to come to Singapore, giving her his credit card details to book flight tickets. In the petition, the woman also alleged that the co-accused made a video of the rape in Singapore in 2023. She further alleged that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Bhartia thereafter that year. In the company's filing with the stock exchange, Jubiliant FoodWorks said the court had made it clear it had not gone into the ""merits of the complaint"". It rubbished the allegations against Bhartia saying they were made with a ""clear mala fide intent against him"".",2025-02-26T11:18:46.096Z,Meryl Sebastian
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx2nedlzgko,Indian doctors remove teen's 'parasitic' twin in rare surgery,"Doctors in the Indian capital, Delhi, have performed a life-changing surgery on a 17-year-old boy to remove his ""parasitic"" twin that was attached to his abdomen. A parasitic twin is an underdeveloped conjoined twin that relies entirely on the host twin for survival. They are extremely rare, with less than one case occurring per 100,000 births. The teenager who had a fully developed extra set of limbs and a pelvis - sustained by a chest artery - underwent a two-hour surgery at Aiims hospital in Delhi. Dr Asuri Krishna, who led the team of specialists, said the surgery was particularly challenging because of the patient's age. ""Only 40-50 cases of parasitic twins have been documented in world medical literature and, in those cases, the surgery had been attempted on children,"" Dr Krishna told the BBC. With insufficient medical literature to guide them, the team had to rely on their ""intuition, skill and knowledge"", he added. Parasitic twins form when one foetus partially develops while attached to the other. In this case, the teenager had two fully formed legs, buttocks and external genitalia - weighing nearly 15kg - protruding from his abdomen. Remarkably, the parasitic limbs could feel pain, touch and change in temperature. Dr Krishna said the first thing they did was identify how interconnected the parasitic and host twins were. Through scans, the doctors found out that the parasitic twin was attached to the teen's breastbone and was being supplied blood from a vessel in his chest. ""But there wasn't much connection with other main organs like the liver or kidneys,"" Dr Krishna said, adding that they also found a large cyst in the teen's abdomen. The surgery was done in two stages - first, removing the parasitic twin, then extracting the cystic mass from surrounding organs. A team of doctors, including radiologists, anaesthetists and plastic surgeons, completed the procedure in two-and-a-half hours. ""A mesh of shared blood vessels, nerves and tissues had to be separated. Care had to be taken to see that none of the host's organs or tissues were damaged,"" Dr Krishna said. During surgery, the teen's blood pressure dropped dangerously as 30-40% of his blood flowed to the parasitic twin. But the doctors said they were prepared for it and swiftly stabilised him. The teen was discharged four days after being admitted. He is healthy and has suffered no complications from the surgery, Dr Krishna says. The teenager's unusual appearance made him the subject of gossip and ridicule in his neighbourhood in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh. The stares and jokes took a toll on his mental health, leaving him feeling isolated and lonely. ""I couldn't travel anywhere or do any physical activity,"" he told the Indian Express newspaper, adding that he had dropped out of school in the eighth grade. The 17-year-old told the Express that he was ecstatic and now wanted to live an active life. ""I hope to study and get a job. A new world has opened up to me,"" he said.",2025-02-26T08:51:28.978Z,Cherylann Mollan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q47qleey8o,Bangladesh wooed by China as ties with India fray,"A 22-member Bangladeshi delegation of political leaders, civil society activists, academics and journalists have begun a 10-day visit to China. They will be having talks with Chinese government officials and senior members of the ruling Communist Party, a delegation leader confirmed with the BBC. Analysts say China is making overtures while diplomatic tensions have risen between Bangladesh and India on a range of issues. This includes ousted Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina living in exile in India. Dhaka has requested her extradition but Delhi has refused. Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior official from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) who's leading the delegation in Beijing, told the BBC: ""It's basically a goodwill visit, initiated by Beijing."" ""It is unique because China this time has invited a team representing various groups in Bangladesh."" Many of the delegation members are from the BNP and its allies. The BNP, headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, is one of the main parties in Bangladesh, besides the Awami League led by Hasina. The delegation also includes several representatives from the student movement that began the mass uprising against Hasina that eventually ousted the prime minister in August last year. An interim government led by the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is currently in charge. It has been urging India to repatriate Hasina to face charges of crimes against humanity and money laundering, among other allegations. The UN says Hasina's government's crackdown on protesters during the uprising killed about 1,400 people. So far India has showed no sign of extraditing Hasina, who denies the charges. Delhi and Dhaka had maintained close ties during the 15-year rule of Ms Hasina, who was widely seen by her critics as pro-India, although she also balanced it with her relationship with Beijing. Following the fall of Hasina, Beijing has stepped up its interaction with Bangladeshi leaders, activists and delegations, including those from Islamist parties. This week's visit follows a meeting between the Bangladesh interim government's foreign policy advisor Touhid Hossain and the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing in January. It also marks the second time BNP officials have visited China in recent months, after Beijing hosted a BNP delegation late last year. With the political vacuum and absence of India's influence, analysts say, Beijing is trying to increase its foothold in Bangladesh, a country of about 170 million people. China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner with bilateral trade amounting to around $24bn (£19bn) - the vast majority of that consists of Chinese exports to the South Asian country. The Bangladeshi military also heavily relies on Chinese equipment and ammunition with more than 70% of supplies coming from China.  Compared to Beijing's overtures, India has had very limited interactions with the interim government and other Bangladeshi political leaders in the past six months. The BNP held a protest in December alleging India's interference in Bangladesh's internal matters by hosting Hasina. Some advisors of the interim government have also criticised Delhi on the same issue. This criticism has sparked sharp reaction from Delhi. The Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said last week that it was up to Bangladesh to decide on ""what kind of relationship they want with us"". He described the criticism of India by Bangladeshi officials and politicians as ""absolutely ridiculous"". Some argue that this increasingly tense rhetoric between Dhaka and Delhi could push Bangladesh towards China. The latest events indicate that Bangladesh has joined fellow South Asian countries Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Nepal as a target for both Delhi and Beijing, as the superpowers jostle for influence. ""I don't believe India should consider the whole subcontinent is under Delhi's sphere of influence. That attitude would make India suffer,"" Chinese analyst Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Beijing's Tsinghua University, told the BBC.",2025-02-25T03:36:12.312Z,Ethirajan Anbarasan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9depxjegw9o,Is India v Pakistan still cricket's greatest rivalry?,"Roaring crowds, faces painted blue and green, flags waving like battle standards. This is the opening of The Greatest Rivalry: India v Pakistan, a new Netflix documentary on one of cricket's most storied contests. India's Virender Sehwag sets the tone: ""This is a contest bigger than one between the bat and ball"". Cut to dramatic footage of some of the matches, the Wagah border, partition refugees. A nation split into two, but forever bound by cricket. Pakistan's Waqar Younis doesn't hesitate: ""I put this rivalry right at the top. There's no match like India v Pakistan."" India's R Ashwin agrees: ""I think this is bigger than the Ashes."" Ramiz Raja says it's ""the political garnish that makes this rivalry world-class"". Despite wars, border standoffs and terror attacks, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry has endured, driven by history and national pride. Even when politics halts the bilateral series, International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments keep the fire alive, turning every match into a high-stakes spectacle. But Pakistan's crushing defeat by India on Sunday at the Champions Trophy has reignited the question: is this rivalry overhyped, propped up by slogans like ""war minus the shooting"" - a phrase George Orwell coined in 1945 to criticise excessive nationalism in sports? Is this still the premier clash in cricket, or just one of its most dramatic? Has it lost its competitive edge, running more on history than intensity? Consider this. From an eight-wicket thrashing in 2018 to a 228-run demolition in 2023, India has dominated, winning six of the last eight ODIs. Pakistan's last victory? The 2017 Champions Trophy final - a fading memory in an increasingly one-sided rivalry. What rivalry, asked Dawn - a leading Pakistani newspaper - pointedly after the latest debacle. A cricket war that's now just a big yawn, headlined India Today magazine. The loss would be easier to accept if Pakistan were at least putting up a fight, according to Dawn's Zohaib Ahmed Majeed. Majeed believes the troubled politics between the two neighbours is the only thing that has kept the rivalry alive. ""In a way we must thank the politicians of these two nations for keeping this rivalry alive, because the cricketers, especially from our side, are certainly incapable of putting up a show that is worthy of its billing,"" he wrote. ""Cut out the war of words and the actual wars and what you'll be left with is a professional cricketing unit against a haphazardly put together team at the last minute. There is no rivalry as far as pure cricketing merits are concerned."" India Today was no less acerbic. ""With its history of one-sided losses to India in recent years, Pakistan cricket is fast sliding into pity territory. And unless it reverses the trend, Pakistan's dream of competing with India could soon turn into a butt of jokes for cricket fans,"" wrote Sandipan Sharma. To be true, Pakistan's cricketing woes keep mounting. They have missed the final four in the last three ODI World Cups, crashed out in the T20 World Cup group stage and now, as hosts of the Champions Trophy, they've hit rock-bottom. Since the 2009 attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, Pakistan cricket has battled isolation, political turmoil, board instability, frequent coaching changes and selection controversies - all adding to its struggles. Meanwhile, across the border, India has risen as cricket's powerhouse, backed by a strong domestic system and the IPL, cricket's richest international league. Pakistani cricket writer Osman Samiuddin also notes a sense of ""marginalisation"" among his country's cricketers, who remain excluded from the IPL and its franchise ecosystem (no Pakistani player has featured in the IPL since 2009, as they were banned after the Mumbai terror attacks). ""I think they see Indian cricketers and others as well, like Australian and English cricketers, as partaking in a world of cricket they have been excluded from,"" he told a programme. This has all contributed to the team's fast-declining fortunes. ""It is a futile exercise to wonder if this is the lowest Pakistan cricket has ever been. However, even when Pakistan have plummeted to spectacular lows in the past, they have done it in a way that justifies the cliché of their mercurial nature,"" wrote Sidharth Monga in ESPNcricinfo, after Sunday's game. ""This slide just feels like a terminal, slow decline. Players are not fighting with each other, there is no backdoor intrigue, there are no cliques in the team plotting to dethrone the captain, there are no comical run-outs or misfields, no defeats snatched from the jaws of victory."" The ""war without guns"" narrative once held weight, especially when Imran Khan's Pakistan, armed with a fearsome pace attack of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and batting stars like Javed Miandad and Inzamam-ul-Haq, regularly got the better of India. ""The narrative may have been true till the early 2000s because this is how the actual fans felt. But it was soon hijacked by the multinationals and the media to cash in on the hyper-pathos of it all,"" Nadeem Farooq Paracha, Pakistani author and columnist, told me. ""The quality of cricket between the two sides isn't the same anymore. Indian cricket continues to get better. In fact, I think the narrative in question here has ended up pressuring Pakistani side more. They underplay it, even though they're more than willing to pocket its financial benefits."" The cricket boards and broadcasters are doing all they can to keep the rivalry alive, and the ICC won't dial down the hype - it's too valuable in an era of overexposure of cricket, limited stars and competition from franchise cricket. This one game has become a financial juggernaut, fuelling a parallel economy wherever it's played - Dubai, London, Ahmedabad - drawing fans who spend big just to be there. ""Pakistan has talent, but the contest now feels more psychological,"" says cricket writer Gautam Bhattacharyya. Brand consultant Santosh Desai feels the real contest between the arch rivals plays out beyond the cricket ground and the ""rivalry thrives more in imagination than in reality"". ""The asymmetry [between the two sides] only fuels the hype. India's dominance makes it an easy narrative to sell, a battle royale where the outcome feels preordained. If Pakistan were winning consistently, the marketing appeal would fade. The rivalry's commercial power lies in India's superiority, feeding a script designed for validation, not uncertainty,"" Desai told me. India's vice-captain Shubman Gill dismisses talk of overhyping, calling it a contest fans love to watch. ""It is an exciting contest when both of these teams play. Everyone enjoys watching it. If so many people are happy to watch the match, then who are we to say that it is underhyped or overhyped,"" he told reporters on eve of Sunday's game. Gill is possibly right. Tickets for India-Pakistan games still fly off the shelves - the ICC reported sellouts within minutes. An astonishing 600 plus million viewers tuned in to watch Sunday's match on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar, setting new records. But for now, as cricket writer Ayaz Memon puts it, ""the hype is more thrilling than the cricket itself"".",2025-02-25T00:25:13.068Z,Soutik Biswas
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4lp2pw9pko,Taliban says it will try to release British couple as soon as possible,"The Taliban has told the BBC it will endeavour to release two British nationals who have been arrested and held in Afghanistan ""as soon as possible"". Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were arrested on 1 February while returning to their home in the country's Bamiyan province. An American national and an Afghan were also arrested alongside the couple, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs said. The UK Foreign Office said on Monday it was supporting their family. In a statement, Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: ""A series of considerations is being taken into account, and after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible."" All three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards, he added. The reason for Mr and Mrs Reynolds's arrest has not been confirmed. The couple had been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years, including one that involved training mothers and children. Their work had apparently been approved by the local authorities, despite the Taliban banning education for girls over the age of 12 and not allowing women to work. The Taliban announced women would be banned from working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 2022. Last December, it said it would close any NGOs employing women. The pair married in Kabul in 1970. They remained in Afghanistan after the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, which saw most westerners leave the country. Their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the BBC she had not heard from her parents in more than two weeks. They had communicated by text after the pair were initially arrested, but contact stopped after three days. Ms Entwistle and her siblings wrote to the Taliban to plead for their parents' release. ""We recognise that there have been instances where exchanges have been beneficial for your government and western nations,"" they wrote. ""However, our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded."" On Monday, Ms Entwistle said they had wanted to give the Taliban an opportunity ""to explain their reasons,"" because Mr and Mrs Reynolds had ""always sought to honour"" the group. But she said they could no longer wait, telling Times Radio: ""We are now urgently calling on the British consulate to do everything in their power to get us answers and to put as much pressure as they can on the Taliban for their release"". The UK shut its embassy in Kabul and withdrew its diplomats from the country after the Taliban returned to power. The Foreign Office says support for British nationals in Afghanistan is therefore ""severely limited"" and advises against all travel to the country.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1xjpnkl2o,UK and India relaunch trade talks in Delhi,"India and the UK have restarted free trade talks, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries. Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's business and trade secretary, met his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in Delhi on Monday and kicked off the two-day discussions. The talks focused on ""advancing"" the negotiations and ensuring that the deal was ""balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial"", Goyal wrote on X. The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach. Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK. Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a ""top priority"" for his government. ""Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,"" he said in a statement ahead of the meeting. India is forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised. For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to impose reciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffs on imported goods from countries, including India. The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30. The UK had announced in November last year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year. The two countries share a trade relationship worth £41bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries. London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars. India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times. It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits. Speaking at the joint conference, Goyal said that immigration was not a part of the discussions. ""India has never ever discussed immigration in any free trade negotiations,"" he said. Reynolds added that business mobility was a ""separate issue"" from immigration. During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram. UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru. After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing agreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, it signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations. It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",2025-02-24T10:54:25.356Z,Nikita Yadav
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce30l5497x2o,NZ minister resigns after he 'placed hand' on staff's arm,"New Zealand's commerce minister Andrew Bayly has resigned as a government minister after he ""placed a hand"" on a staff member's upper arm last week, in what he described as ""overbearing"" behaviour. Bayly said on Monday that he was ""deeply sorry"" about the incident, which he described as not an argument but an ""animated discussion"". He remains a member of parliament. His resignation comes after he was criticised last October for calling a winery worker a ""loser""- including putting his fingers in an 'L' shape on his forehead - and allegedly using an expletive directed at them. He later issued a public apology. ""As many of you know, I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios,"" Bayly said in a statement announcing his resignation. ""Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate."" He said a complaint had been made but would not elaborate further on exactly what had happened. Bayly resigned last Friday, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon later told a press conference, adding that the incident happened three days earlier, on 18 February. Luxon said on Monday the government's handling the issue within a week was ""pretty quick"" and ""pretty impressive"". He denied that he should have asked Bayly to step down following October's winery incident, and said ""never say never"" when asked if there was a way back for the 63-year-old into another cabinet position. However, Labour leader Chris Hipkins criticised Luxon as being ""incredibly weak"", saying the incident with the staff member should not have been dragged over the weekend. ""Christopher Luxon has once again set the bar for ministerial behaviour so low, that it would be almost impossible not to get over it,"" he told reporters on Monday. Bayly himself said that he had to talk to his family and ""would have had difficulty"" speaking to the media earlier. He was first elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 2014 as an MP for the current ruling National Party. He was appointed the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Minister for Small Business and Manufacturing, and Minister of Statistics following Luxon's election in late 2023. He was also appointed minister for the ACC - the national accidental injury compensation scheme - following a cabinet reshuffle earlier this year. Before joining politics, Bayly worked in the finance industry. Luxon said Scott Simpson, National's senior whip, would take over the ACC and Commerce and Consumer Affairs portfolios. Bayly is the first minister to resign of his own accord under PM Luxon, whose favourability has dipped considerably, according to recent polls. Both the 1News-Verian poll and the Post/Freshwater Strategy poll show his National-led coalition government is losing support among voters. The government has recently come under fire for some policies that were seen by some as anti-Māori, including the introduction of a bill that many argued undermined Māori rights and the dissolution of the Māori Health Authority - which was set up under the last Labour government to try and create greater health equality.",2025-02-24T07:07:09.166Z,Koh Ewe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9vde5y1ezo,Trump's '$21m for voter turnout' claim triggers political row in India,"US President Donald Trump's remark that his country spent $21m to boost voter turnout in India's elections has triggered a political slugfest in the country. He made the remark days after a team led by Elon Musk said it had cancelled the payout as part of its crackdown on a US agency providing foreign aid. India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called the payout an ""external interference"" and accused the opposition Congress party of seeking this intervention. The Congress denied the allegation, calling Trump's claims ""nonsensical"". The US has not provided any evidence to support its claim. On Friday, India's foreign ministry said it found the claims ""deeply troubling"". Foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said it was ""premature"" to make public statements about the matter at this stage and that relevant authorities were investigating it. Trump vowed to boost the US economy and soon after returning to office, he created the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led by Musk, to slash federal spending and jobs. Musk says Doge's mission is to save taxpayer money and cut national debt. One of its biggest moves - now making global headlines - is a crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid since the 1960s. Musk, who has called USAID a ""criminal organisation"", announced on Sunday that funding for several projects had been cancelled. The cuts included $486m for the ""Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening"", with ""$21m for voter turnout in India"" and ""$22m for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova"". Defending Doge's cuts, Trump said India ""had a lot of money"" and was among the world's highest-taxing nations. On Thursday, he doubled down, questioning the $21m spend on ""India's voter turnout"". The latest comments came a week after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first Washington visit under Trump's second term, where Trump announced expanded military sales, increased energy exports and plans for a trade deal and new defence framework. ""I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government,"" the US president said at a summit in Miami. The same day, BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a clip of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi speaking at an event in London before the 2024 general election. In the clip, Gandhi can be heard saying that major democracies like the US and European countries were ""oblivious that a huge chunk of democratic model has come undone [in India]"". ""Rahul Gandhi was in London, urging foreign powers - from the US to Europe - to intervene in India's internal affairs,"" Malviya alleged in his post on X. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh dismissed the claim and urged the government to report on USAID's decades-long support to governmental and non-governmental institutions during PM Modi's tenure. Despite widespread reports, neither Doge nor Trump has provided evidence that USAID gave India $21m for voter turnout. India's poll panel has not responded, but former election chief SY Qureshi denied receiving such funding during his tenure, which ran from 2010 to 2012. Earlier, Malviya claimed that in 2012, under Mr Qureshi, the panel signed an agreement with a group linked to George Soros' foundation - primarily funded by USAID - to support a voter turnout campaign. Mr Qureshi dismissed the allegation as ""malicious"", stating that the agreement explicitly imposed ""no financial or legal obligation on either side"". On Friday, the Indian Express newspaper said in an investigative report that the $21m was sanctioned for Bangladesh and not India. It was meant to run for three years until July 2025 and that $13.4m had already been spent, according to records accessed by the newspaper.",2025-02-21T10:51:50.151Z,Cherylann Mollan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crknd1e86x4o,Man disguised as lawyer kills gang leader in court,"A notorious gang leader has died after he was shot inside a courthouse in Sri Lanka by a gunman disguised as a lawyer, say police. Police say the gunman used a revolver which was smuggled in a hollowed-out book by a female suspect, who remains at large. Gang leader Sanjeewa Kumara Samararathne had been escorted to court to face proceedings when he was shot. Police say he was a suspect in multiple murder cases. The shooting in the capital Colombo is among a series of killings by rivalling gangs, which has persisted as authorities vow to crack down on gang violence in the country. The gang leader, popularly known as Ganemulle Sanjeewa, had been in custody since he was arrested in September 2023. Police said he had been escorted to the courthouse on Wednesday by a dozen police officers. He was taken to hospital after he was shot but was pronounced dead on arrival. The gunman managed to flee the scene but was later captured by police. He has been identified differently by authorities and local media, but police say that he used several names. Police have identified the female suspect as 25-year-old Pinpura Dewage Ishara Sewwandi. Authorities have put out a notice promising a reward for anyone providing information on the woman. Police say they have also arrested a policeman and van driver suspected of helping the two suspects in the shooting. Lawmakers discussed reining in gang violence in parliament on Wednesday, with an opposition MP calling it a ""major security issue"". Health and mass media minister Nalinda Jayatissa, who in December had pledged to crack down on such criminal activity, said on Wednesday that the government would ""take the actions of organised underworld gangs seriously."" The incident has also raised questions about security in the courthouse, with authorities currently reviewing security measures. New security protocols are being implemented in the wake of the shooting, including deploying armed guards when certain people are brought to court.

Beijing and Hong Kong's government have argued that such moves were necessary for national security. As part of the crackdown, Beijing overhauled the former British colony's polling systems. The so-called ""patriots law"" was passed in Hong Kong in 2021 that ensured only people regarded as loyal to the Communist regime in Beijing could serve as lawmakers or local councillors in the semi-autonomous territory. This law effectively barred the Democratic Party from taking part in elections. At a late-night press conference on Tuesday after a party meeting, Mr Lo said the party's leaders had made the call to wind down based on the ""current political situation"". ""Developing democracy in Hong Kong is always difficult, and it's especially difficult in the past few years,"" Mr Lo said to reporters. He did not comment when asked if the party's leaders' decision had been made under political pressure. The party has set up a work group for the shutdown process. At least 75% of its members attending an upcoming general meeting will have to approve the move before it is final. A date for that meeting is yet to be set. On Wednesday, Hong Kong government adviser Regina Ip accused the Democratic Party of pursuing an agenda that opposed China and ""constantly causing trouble inside and outside parliament"". ""Therefore I am not surprised at all that they have been losing supporters in recent years... the Democratic Party has already reached a dead end,"" said Ms Ip, co-convener of Hong Kong's cabinet-like Executive Council. The Democratic Party was notable for having rare direct negotiations with the Liaison Office - the Chinese Communist government's representation in Hong Kong - in 2010, to discuss plans for more liberal elections. Its younger members, however, saw those negotiations as a betrayal. The move triggered a split while the party lost support. It subsequently regained strength and became the most successful opposition political force in the city after acquiring the most seats in the 2019 local council elections, which took place during the violent anti-government protests. A number of the Democratic Party's members - including prominent pro-democracy figures Helena Wong, Lam Cheuk-ting, Wu Chi-wai and Albert Ho - are among the Hong Kong 47 group of campaigners jailed under the controversial national security law. Another member, former legislator Ted Hui, is now living in Australia in exile and is wanted by the Hong Kong government for alleged national security offences. Earlier this week a court issued an order to confiscate his assets and money in Hong Kong, which are held by his family and a law firm. In December, Hong Kong stripped the honorary Justice of the Peace title from Martin Lee KC, a key founder of the Democratic Party, after the veteran barrister lost his appeal against an unauthorised assembly conviction.",2025-02-21T04:32:14.071Z,Martin Yip
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0nzel19v1o,Six elephants dead after being hit by train in Sri Lanka,"A passenger train derailed after striking a herd of elephants near a wildlife reserve in central Sri Lanka in the early hours of Thursday. While no injuries were reported among passengers, six elephants died from the accident in Habarana, east of the capital Colombo. Two injured elephants were being treated, police said, noting that it was the worst such wildlife accident the country had seen, AFP reported. It is not uncommon for trains to run into herds of elephants in Sri Lanka, where casualties on both sides of human-elephant encounters are among the highest in the world. Last year, more than 170 people and nearly 500 elephants were killed in human-elephant encounters overall - and around 20 elephants are killed by trains annually, according to local media. Elephants, whose natural habitats are affected by deforestation and shrinking resources, have increasingly strayed into places of human activity. Some have urged train drivers to slow down and sound the train horns to warn animals ahead on railway tracks. In 2018, a pregnant elephant and its two calves similarly died in Habarana after being struck by a train. The three had been part of a larger herd crossing the train tracks at dawn. Last October, another train ran into a herd in Minneriya, about 25km (15 miles) away from Habarana, killing two elephants and injuring one. There are an estimated 7,000 wild elephants in Sri Lanka, where the animals, revered by its Buddhist majority, are protected by law. Killing an elephant is a crime punishable by imprisonment or a fine.",2025-02-20T07:46:01.976Z,Koh Ewe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq2zd2ep8ro,Search for missing India miners ends as bodies recovered after 44 days,"Rescuers have ended a 44-day search operation after they found the bodies of five men who were trapped inside a flooded coal mine in India's north-eastern state of Assam. DNA tests will be conducted to identify the men as the bodies are in a decomposed state, a state official told the BBC. On 6 January, nine miners were trapped after water flooded the so-called ""rat-hole"" mine, which is a narrow hole dug manually to extract coal. Four bodies were recovered within the first week, and search operations had continued until Wednesday, when the remaining bodies were found. ""The process to identify the remains has been initiated,"" Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on the social media platform X. The families of the miners have also been called to identify the bodies. They will be given compensation by the state government, said Riki Phukan, an official from Assam's District Disaster Management Authority. The search operations - at the Umrangso coal mine in Assam's Dima Hasao district - were jointly conducted by special disaster forces alongside the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the state police and the district disaster authority. Divers and helicopters were also deployed but the remote, hilly terrain of the mine had posed severe challenges. Earlier, one of the men rescued from the mine had shared with the BBC a harrowing account of the moments after the tunnel was suddenly engulfed by water. Ravi Rai, a worker from Nepal, said that he was working inside the mine when water entered the pit. ""We were holding on to a rope in 50-60ft (15-18m) deep water for at least 50 minutes before being pulled out,"" he said. Despite a ban on ""rat-hole"" mining in India since 2014, small illegal mines continue to be operational in Assam and other north-eastern states. Six workers were killed in January 2024 after a fire broke out in a rat-hole coal mine in Nagaland state. In 2018, at least 15 men were trapped in an illegal mine in Meghalaya after water from a nearby river flooded it. After the recent accident, police in Assam have said they are investigating illegal mining activities in the state.",2025-02-20T07:24:42.424Z,"Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Delhi"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxl8lrlnxo,"No faecal bacteria in Kumbh Mela river waters, says minister","The chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state has rejected a government report that found high levels of contamination in a key bathing place at the Kumbh Mela, the world's largest gathering. The report said the waters at Sangam - the confluence of rivers considered holy by Hindus - in Prayagraj city had alarming levels of untreated sewage and bacteria found in human and animal excreta, making it unfit for bathing. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath insisted that the water was not just fit for bathing, but also safe for doing aachman - the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after bathing. Authorities say 565 million have bathed since the festival began on 13 January. The Kumbh Mela (also known as Mahakumbh) - is held once every 12 years. Hindus believe that taking a dip at Sangam - the confluence of India's most sacred Ganges river with the Yamuna river and the mythical Saraswati - will cleanse them of sins, purify their soul and help them attain salvation. The Mela, which stretches over six weeks, draws devotees from all walks of life and from all around the world. Tens of millions have been bathing in the rivers daily during the festival, which will end on 26 February. However, health activists and environmentalists have expressed concern over the water quality of the rivers during the festival. Before the Mela began, India's top environment court had directed the pollution control boards of the federal and state governments to monitor the water in the rivers regularly and to take adequate steps to maintain its quality. But a report submitted by the federal government's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) earlier this month stated that the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna had high coliform levels. Coliform level is a key indicator of the presence of untreated sewage and faecal bacteria in water. The report said that the coliform levels in the Ganges were 1,400 times more than the acceptable limit, and in the Yamuna river, they were 660 times more. The CPCB analysed water samples from both the rivers on five separate days in January, but the coliform levels never met standards, the report added. Chief Minister Adityanath, however, insisted that his government was continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality. ""All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification,"" he said. ""The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is as per the standards,"" he added. He accused the opposition of running a ""false campaign"" to defame the Kumbh Mela. This is not the first time that the Uttar Pradesh government has come under scrutiny for the way it has organised and is managing the Kumbh Mela. On one of the most auspicious bathing days in January, at least 30 people died in a crush that took place near the Sangam. On Sunday, another crush at the New Delhi Railway Station - where thousands of devotees had gathered to board trains for Prayagraj - killed around 18 people.",2025-02-19T13:08:18.631Z,Cherylann Mollan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86pl55x0qno,'Real life Squid Game': Kim Sae-ron's death exposes Korea's celebrity culture,"Actress Kim Sae-ron's death in an apparent suicide has renewed criticism of South Korea's entertainment industry, which churns out stars but also subjects them to immense pressure and scrutiny. Kim - who was found dead aged 24 at her home in Seoul on Sunday - had been bombarded with negative press coverage and hate online after a drink-driving conviction in 2022. Police have not provided further details about her death. Experts found the circumstances leading to it depressingly familiar. Other celebrities also ended up taking their lives after careers upended by cyberbullying. As Kim was laid to rest on Wednesday, analysts say they are not optimistic her death will lead to meaningful change. South Korea's entertainment industry is enjoying massive popularity. Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world – that's four times the population of South Korea. But there is also increasing spotlight on the less glamorous side of the entertainment industry. South Korea is known for its hyper-competitive culture in most spheres of life - from education to careers. It has one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising. This pressure is heightened in the case of celebrities. They face immense pressure to be perfect, and are subjected to the demands of obsessive ""super fans"" who can make or break careers. That is why even the slightest perceived misstep can be career ending. Kim Sae-ron became so unpopular, scenes featuring her were edited out of shows such as Netflix's 2023 drama Bloodhounds. ""It is not enough that the celebrities be punished by the law. They become targets of relentless criticism,"" Korean culture critic Kim Hern-sik told the BBC. He referred to K-pop artists Sulli and Goo Hara, who died by suicide in 2019 after long battles with internet trolls, even though they did not have known brushes with the law. Sulli had offended fans for not conforming to the K-pop mould, while an internet mob had targeted Goo Hara over her relationship with an ex-boyfriend.   Cyberbullying has also become a money-making gig for some, Kim Hern-sik told the BBC. ""YouTubers get the views, forums get the engagement, news outlets get the traffic. I don't think [Kim's death] will change the situation. ""There needs to be harsher criminal punishment against leaving nasty comments,"" he says. Kim Sae-ron's father has blamed a YouTuber for her death, claiming the controversial videos they published caused her deep emotional distress. Others have pointed fingers at some local media outlets, who reportedly fuelled public animosity against Kim by reporting the unverified claims. ""This cycle of media-driven character assassination must stop,"" civic group Citizens' Coalition for Democratic Media said in a statement on Tuesday. Na Jong-ho, a psychiatry professor at Yale University, likened the spate of celebrity deaths in South Korea to a real-life version of Squid Game, the South Korean Netflix blockbuster which sees the indebted fighting to the death for a huge cash prize. ""Our society abandons those who stumble and moves on as if nothing happened.. How many more lives must be lost before we stop inflicting this destructive, suffocating shame on people?"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Drunk driving is a big mistake. There would be a problem with our legal system if that goes unpunished. However, a society that buries people who make mistakes without giving them a second chance is not a healthy one,"" Prof Na added. Last year, the BBC reported on how ""super fans"" in the notorious K-pop industry try to dictate their idols' private lives - from their romantic relationships to their daily activities outside of work - and can be unforgiving when things go off script. It is no surprise that Kim Sae-ron chose to withdraw from the public eye after her DUI conviction, for which she was fined 20 million won (£11,000) in April 2023.  It is worth noting however, that not all public figures are subject to the same treatment. Politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, also have past drink-driving convictions but have been able to bounce back - polls show Lee is now the country's top presidential contender. In South Korea, it is ""extremely tough"" for artistes to recover when they do something that puts a crack in their ""idol"" image, says K-pop columnist Jeff Benjamin. He contrasts this to entertainment industries in the West, where controversies and scandals sometimes even ""add a rockstar-like edge"" to celebrities' reputations. ""While no one cheers when a Hollywood celebrity is arrested for DUI [driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs] or sent to jail for significant crimes, it's not necessarily career-ending,"" he says. While the Korean entertainment industry has made moves to address performers' mental health concerns, it is unclear how effective these have been. Real change can only happen when there is no more financial or attention incentives to continue with such intrusive reporting, says Mr Benjamin.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdr4r2l31o,Philippine town offers bounty for mosquitoes as dengue rises,"Authorities in one of the Philippines' most densely-populated urban centres are offering a cash reward for mosquitoes in an attempt to stop the spread of dengue. Carlito Cernal, village chief of Barangay Addition Hills in central Manila, announced the bounty of one peso (less than two US cents) for every five mosquitoes. While news of the bounty has provoked scorn on social media, Mr Cernal has defended it as necessary for the community's health. The move follows a recent spike in cases of dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes, in the Philippines. The programme, which will run for at least a month, was started after two students in Mr Cernal's neighbourhood died from the disease. The bounty applies to all mosquitoes - dead or alive - and their larvae, Mr Cernal added. Live mosquitoes will be exterminated using ultraviolet light. A total of 21 people have already claimed their reward, bringing in a total of 700 mosquitoes and larvae so far, he told the BBC. The bounty drew swift ridicule after it was announced late on Tuesday. ""Mosquito farming is coming,"" one social media comment read. ""Will a mosquito get rejected if it has only one wing?"" read another. The Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) told the BBC that it ""appreciates the good intentions of local government executives to fight dengue"". It declined further comment, however, when asked if catching mosquitoes in exchange for cash is an effective way of stopping dengue. ""We urge all concerned to please consult and coordinate with their local health officers or the DOH regional office in their area for evidence-based practices that are known to work,"" it said. Mr Cernal said he was aware that the bounty had been bashed on social media, but added: ""This is one of the biggest and most dense areas. We have to do something to help the local government."" He pointed out that local health authorities recorded 44 cases of dengue in the community during the most recent surge of infections. Barangay Addition Hills is home to nearly 70,000 people, crammed into a 162-hectare patch at the heart of the capital, Metro Manila. Mr Cernal said the bounty was meant to supplement existing measures such as cleaning the streets and preventing the build-up of water where dengue-carrying mosquitoes lay their eggs. Dengue is endemic in tropical countries, and outbreaks often occur in urban areas with poor sanitation which allows virus-carrying mosquitoes to multiply. In severe cases, dengue causes internal bleeding which can lead to death. Its symptoms include headaches, nausea, joint and muscle pain. Philippine authorities have recently flagged a rise in dengue cases nationwide due to seasonal rains. The DOH said it recorded 28,234 cases on 1 February, a 40% jump from the previous year. The department has advised the public to maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings, destroy potential mosquito breeding sites such as tyres, wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers and apply mosquito repellent. Aside from dengue, the DOH said the rains have also fuelled a spike in influenza-like diseases and cases of leptospirosis, a rat-borne disease that people get when wading in flood waters.",2025-02-19T10:08:41.983Z,Virma Simonette & Joel Guinto
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrxlnpeyx5o,Man jailed for attempted murder of former Japan PM,"A man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the attempted murder of Japan's former prime minister Fumio Kishida in 2023. Ryuji Kimura, 25, hurled a pipe bomb at Kishida as the country's leader approached a crowd for a speech during an election event in the city of Wakayama. Although Kishida was unharmed, the explosion of the homemade device caused minor injuries to a police officer and a member of the public. The attack shocked Japan as it came less than a year after former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead at an outdoor election campaign event. Kimura, who was sentenced on Wednesday, claimed during questioning his intention was not to kill Kishida, but to object to the country's election age regulation which prevented him from getting into politics. The minimum age to become a member of parliament in Japan is 25 for the House of Representatives and 30 for the House of Councillors. Kimura further added that he threw the bomb to bring attention to a civil lawsuit he filed in 2022, claiming the age restriction was unconstitutional, which was dismissed. Kimura's defence argued he should not face a charge of attempted murder, as he did not expect the bomb to cause injuries, and that a three-year prison sentence would be reasonable given the extent of those injuries. The court stated, however, that the explosives were powerful enough to cause fatal damage. When handing down the ruling, presiding judge Keiko Fukushima noted that ""targeting a serving prime minister caused significant anxiety to society as a whole."" In addition to the attempted murder charge, Kimura was also found guilty of violating explosives regulations and firearms control laws. His 10-year sentence is five years less than what prosecutors had sought. While violent attacks are extremely rare in Japan, anxiety around politicians' security has surged in the wake of Abe's assassination in 2022. The attempted attack on Kishida, which came less than a year later, raised questions as to why there was not a tighter security presence around the country's leader at that time.",2025-02-19T07:06:46.861Z,Shaimaa Khalil
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2k2ly8j75o,'Died for stealing chocolate': Pakistan anger over death of child maid,"A couple in north-east Pakistan has been detained on suspicion of murdering a 13-year-old girl who worked for them as a maid, for allegedly stealing chocolates. The girl who goes only by one name, Iqra, succumbed to multiple injuries in hospital last Wednesday. A preliminary police investigation said she had been tortured. The case in Rawalpindi has sparked widespread outrage and posts with the hashtag #JusticeforIqra having garnered tens of thousands of views, and reignited a debate over child labour and the mistreatment of domestic workers. Laws pertaining to child labour can vary across the country, but children under the age of 15 cannot be employed as domestic workers in the province of Punjab. ""I felt completely shattered inside when she died,"" Iqra's father, Sana Ullah, told the BBC. He said that he had received a call from the police about Iqra last Wednesday. When he rushed to the hospital, he saw Iqra lying on a bed, unconscious. She died minutes later. Iqra began working as a maid from the age of eight. Her father, a 45-year-old farmer, said he had sent her to work because he was in debt. After working for a few employers, she went to work for the couple two years ago, who have eight children of their own. She was earning about £23 ($28) per month. Police said Iqra had been accused of stealing chocolates from her employers, adding that a preliminary investigation showed that Iqra had been tortured. Police also say there was evidence of frequent abuse. Pictures and videos obtained by the BBC showed multiple fractures in her legs and arms, as well as a serious injury to her head. An autopsy is being conducted to assess the full extent of her injuries, and the police has told the BBC that they were still awaiting the final medical report. ""My heart cries tears of blood. How many... are subjected to violence in their homes every day for a trivial job of a few thousand?"" activist Shehr Bano wrote on X. ""How long will the poor continue to lower their daughters into graves in this way?"" Others have pointed out that her murder was allegedly triggered by something so minor. ""She died over chocolate?"" asked one Pakistani user on X. ""This is not just a crime, it's a reflection of [a] system that enables [the] rich to treat [the] poor as disposable,"" another said. Iqra's employers, Rashid Shafiq and his wife Sana, have been arrested, along with a Quran teacher, who worked for the family. The teacher had brought Iqra to the hospital and left after telling hospital staff that the girl's father had died and her mother was not around. Police told the BBC it was unclear if she believed this to be the truth. Iqra's father says he wants to see ""those responsible for my daughter's death punished"". Despite the public outrage such cases usually garner, they are typically settled out of court and it's rare for suspects to be successfully prosecuted. In 2018, a judge and his wife were sentenced to three years in jail for torturing their then 10-year-old maid in what had been a highly publicised case that sparked outrage across the country. But they later had their sentences reduced to one year. Tayyaba was found with severe injuries, which the Pakistan Institute of Medical Science said included burns to her hands and feet. Pictures of the girl also showed cuts and bruising to her face, along with a swollen left eye. She told prosecutors she was beaten for losing a broom. Under Pakistani law, victims or their families have the right to forgive suspects in a number of serious crimes. To do so, they have to state in court that they forgive a suspect ""in the name of God"". In reality, legal observers say that the primary motive for that ""forgiveness"" is normally financial, and paying victims is not illegal. About 3.3 million children in Pakistan are engaged in child labour, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). Moreover, women and young girls make up the vast majority of Pakistan's 8.5 million domestic workers, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).",2025-02-18T09:02:20.287Z,Azadeh Moshiri
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g0dxkv3mo,Pritam Singh: Singapore opposition leader guilty of lying to parliament,"Singapore's opposition leader Pritam Singh has been found guilty of lying under oath to a parliamentary committee. A court imposed the maximum fine of S$7,000 ($5,223; £4,148) for each of two charges. Singh said that he would appeal against the conviction and sentence. The charges relate to Singh's handling of Raeesah Khan, a former lawmaker from his party, who lied to parliament in a separate case. The verdict in this high-profile trial comes as Singapore is gearing up for its next general election, which must be held by November. Singh's Workers' Party holds nine out of 87 elected seats in parliament. Under Singapore's constitution, any MP can lose their seat or be barred from running for office for five years if they are fined at least S$10,000 or jailed for more than a year. The election department has since clarified that the S$10,000 threshold only applies to a single offence, according to local media. This means Singh's fines will not trigger disqualification. ""The question on most people's minds is the consequences for the upcoming election,"" Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC. Singh's case could either be ""played up"" by state media or ""fizzle out"" of public attention, he said. Singh told reporters outside the court on Monday that he intended to run in the upcoming election. The verdict on Monday, which lasted more than two hours, was delivered to a packed courtroom. Members of the press who could not fit into the courtroom, including the BBC, viewed a livestream of the verdict from a separate room. District Judge Luke Tan, who delivered the verdict, said several pieces of evidence showed that Singh ""never wanted Ms Khan to clarify [her] lie"" and had ""direct and intimate involvement"" in guiding Khan to continue her narrative. Prosecutors sought the maximum fine of S$7,000 for each of Singh's two charges, while the defence asked for S$4,000. Singh, 48, maintained his innocence throughout the trial, arguing that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue. Singh's case has gripped the city-state, where a usually uneventful political scene - dominated by the ruling People's Action Party - has in recent years seen a rare string of scandals. The saga started in August 2021 when Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed the police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim. She later admitted that her anecdote was not true. Khan was fined S$35,000 for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege. She has since resigned from the party and parliament. During a parliamentary committee investigation into the incident later that year, Khan testified that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to ""continue with the narrative"" despite finding out that it was not true. This was prior to her eventual admission. Singh denied this, but also said that he had given Khan ""too much time to settle herself before closing this issue with her"". The parliamentary committee concluded that Singh was not being truthful and referred the case to the public prosecutor. Judge Tan said on Monday that Singh's actions after learning of Khan's lie were ""strongly indicative that the accused did not want Ms Khan to clarify the untruth at some point"". Singh's Workers' Party is the opposition party with the largest presence in parliament. The party made significant gains during the 2020 election, increasing their number of seats from six to 10 - the biggest victory for the opposition since Singapore gained independence in 1965. Singh was named the opposition leader after the polls. One of those seats has since been vacated by Khan.  Additional reporting by Ewe Koh",2025-02-17T08:35:46.544Z,Kelly Ng
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9l9elr95zo,"Special Forces rejected 2,000 credible asylum claims from Afghan commandos, MoD confirms","UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time. UK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban. The MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications. Asked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question. The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK. The rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present. The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence. BBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units. The MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials. The confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge. Documents disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed. Mike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were ""extremely concerning"". ""There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,"" Martin said. ""If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,"" he added. Johnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard ""horrific"" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces. Mercer said it was ""very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry"". The MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as ""credible"" evidence of service with the Triples units. The government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD. Many are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country. ""Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,"" said a former Triples officer. ""The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,"" he said. The officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces ""like brothers"" and felt ""betrayed"" by the widespread rejections. ""If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,"" he said. The MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope. The legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan. ""Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,"" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn. ""As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at."" Lawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections. In court filings, they criticised the ""total inadequacy"" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an ""an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation"" of the process. New evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship. The MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role ""evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior"". But officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014. ""Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,"" said former officer who served with UKSF. ""We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,"" he said. The Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: ""There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93lp2wd0qzo,The A-level student who became an enemy of the Chinese state,"Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents. The choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($128,000; £102,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad. ""I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,"" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. ""But I've ended up with a bounty!"" Chloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago. In 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels. Her protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the café in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest. Hong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her – in which she is aged 11. ""It freaked me out at first,"" she says, but then she fired back a public response. ""I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them."" Chloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997. ""Politics were never in my life before… so I went to the first protest with curiosity,"" she said. She saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck. ""I was so shocked,"" she says. ""That moment actually changed how I looked at the world."" Growing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms – she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about ""what we like and don't like"" and ""could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like"". But the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge. ""I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],"" she says. But when things started to get ""really crazy"", she browbeat her parents into coming with her. At the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the ""raw experience"", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV. After months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. The authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong argue the law is necessary to maintain stability and has not weakened the city's autonomy. But most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies – were suddenly gone. Symbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail. In response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown. At first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around. Unable to afford international student fees of more than £20,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO. When China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target. Her inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas. A Hong Kong government statement said: ""Any individuals who endanger national security should not believe that being overseas will allow them to evade criminal responsibility. ""We must emphasise that the Constitution and the Basic Law steadfastly safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people."" Chloe says the bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK. China has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week. Another Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors. And last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances. ""They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others,"" Chloe says. She says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong. ""Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks,"" she says. ""It's sad but we can't blame them."" On the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate ""any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas"". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK. But more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster. In the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: ""We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK."" But she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers. ""We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China."" Does she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says. ""When I think of what [they] face… it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas."" Bounty targets Update 18 February 2025: This article has been updated to include a response from the Hong Kong government.",2025-02-16T00:00:27.535Z,Frances Mao
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm29drxjlxmo,India anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then died,"Warning: This report contains some disturbing details An Indian court's ruling that a man's forced ""unnatural sex"" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women. The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it. Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault. The lower court had also found the man guilty of ""culpable homicide not amounting to murder"". He was sentenced to ""rigorous imprisonment for 10 years"" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently. But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act. The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. ""To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,"" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan. ""An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,"" she told the BBC. ""It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly."" Priyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this ""sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder"". She added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. ""This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died."" The court documents make for grim reading. According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, ""committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will… causing her a lot of pain"". After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later. In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill ""due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband"". A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence. While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated ""the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation"" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum. Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently – he questioned the ""sanctity"" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India. The lower court's conviction was ""a rarest of rare case"", Ms Shukla said, ""probably because the woman died"". ""But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge."" Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly. India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence. A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860. The British colonial-era law mentions several ""exemptions"" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is ""by a man with his own wife"" if she is not under 15 years. Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book. The idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is ""implied"" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it. But in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape. The Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. In October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be ""excessively harsh"". The federal home ministry said it ""may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage"". Authorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency. ""A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,"" Ms Chauhan said. ""But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?"" she asks. Violence within marriage is rampant in India. According to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% of married women, aged 18-49, who have experienced sexual violence said their current husbands were the perpetrators. And even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame. ""In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,"" the lawyer said. Ms Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes. ""We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out."" She added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a ""man versus woman debate"". ""But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?""",2025-02-15T01:00:34.253Z,Geeta Pandey
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5025n2g2o,Japanese woman arrested for squashing bun in shop,"A woman in Japan has been arrested for allegedly squashing a bun at a convenience store and leaving without buying the packet of bread. Authorities in the southern city of Fukuoka confirmed to the BBC that the 40-year-old had been arrested on Monday for ""criminal damage"". The woman, who said she was unemployed, claimed she ""only checked the firmness of [the bun] by pressing lightly with my hand"", according to police. The woman had allegedly touched a bag of four black sesame and cream cheese buns. While the bag's wrapper was intact, police said one of the buns was damaged after she pressed it with her right thumb, and the entire bag could not be sold. Police said the owner of the Lawson convenience store had claimed he had seen the woman squashing buns several times in the past. As the woman was leaving the shop on Monday, the owner noticed the bun was damaged and he urged her to pay for the bread, according to police. The bag of buns cost about 180 yen (£0.95; $1.20). She allegedly refused. After following her for 1km (0.6mi), the manager restrained her. The police were called to the scene and they arrested her. In recent years, police have been also cracking down on pranksters who have committed ""sushi terrorism"" in sushi conveyor belt restaurants, such as licking communal soy sauce bottles and squashing sushi meant for diners.",2025-02-14T07:41:57.601Z,Koh Ewe and Chie Kobayashi
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c704d73kjpwo,Why Muslims in India are opposing changes to a property law,"A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country. The properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board. The new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion. On 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders. They claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation. The new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community. But several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities. In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God. A vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon. The tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India. The properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties. The government says that the waqf boards are among India’s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; £11.26bn). Muslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. But critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies – which too requires immediate attention. A report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. The committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; £1.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees. The committee also noted that “encroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common”, listing hundreds of instances of such “unauthorised occupation” of waqf land by government authorities. According to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown. The amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties. But many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism. One of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board. Many of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago. The 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of “waqf by user”, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain. Professor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system. “You can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,” Prof Rehman says. Others worry that the new bill may not address the community’s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties. That's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members. Some agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular. But the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. “There seems to be an attempt not only to get the state’s control over Muslims’ properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community’s lives.” Among other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf’s claim to a property is valid. Critics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards. Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land. The current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf. But some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established. ""Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,” Owaisi recently told reporters. This process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind. “The diagnosis may be correct,” Prof Rehman says, “but the treatment is not.”",2025-02-14T06:34:24.585Z,Meryl Sebastian & Neyaz Farooquee
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crke5ngld4lo,Direct rule in violence-hit Indian state after chief minister quits,"The Indian government has brought the troubled north-eastern state of Manipur under direct federal rule days after Chief Minister N Biren Singh resigned. Singh, from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), quit on Sunday after facing months of pressure to step down. Ethnic clashes broke out between the state's majority Meitei and minority Kuki communities in May 2023 over economic benefits, land rights and job quotas. More than 250 people have been killed in the conflict and tens of thousands displaced. The state hit the global headlines in July 2023 when a video showing two women being paraded naked by a mob went viral, sparking outrage in India. While the scale of unrest has reduced since the peak in 2023, divisions between the communities persist and violent incidents continue to occur. Singh's position had become increasingly untenable in recent months with Kuki groups accusing him of favouring the Meitei community, of which he is a member - an accusation he denied. Media reports said there was also rising discontent against him within the BJP. BJP leaders tried but failed to agree on someone to replace him as chief minister. On Thursday evening, the office of President Droupadi Murmu announced that federal rule - known as President's rule in India - had been imposed in the state. ""After receiving a report from the governor and after considering the report and other information received by me, I am satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of that state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of India,"" the statement said. Manipur's last assembly session was held in August and Monday was set to be the first day of the new session, but federally-appointed governor Ajay Bhalla released a statement declaring the session ""null and void"". Earlier, opposition Congress party members had said they would bring a no-confidence motion against the chief minister during the session. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh told the ANI news agency that Singh resigned as he sensed the motion would be passed. Ramesh called for federal Home Minister Amit Shah to resign. Opposition leaders have also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has not visited the state since the violence began. Meanwhile India's Supreme Court is hearing a plea against Singh filed by a Kuki organisation which accuses him of playing a direct role in fuelling the violence. The petitioners have submitted leaked audio tapes to back up their claims. The court has sought a forensic report on the tapes before the next hearing. Singh has denied any wrongdoing. The conflict involves the state's two largest ethnic groups, the majority Meitei and minority Kuki, and their battle over land and influence. Tensions boiled over in May 2023 when Kukis began protesting against demands from the Meiteis to be given official tribal status. The Kukis argued this would strengthen the Meiteis' already strong influence on government and society, allowing them to buy land or settle in predominantly Kuki areas. But there are myriad underlying reasons. The Kukis say a war on drugs waged by the Meitei-led government is a screen to uproot their communities. Since the violence, Manipur has been divided into two camps, with Meiteis inhabiting the Imphal Valley and the Kukis living in the surrounding hill areas. Borders and buffer zones guarded by security forces and community members separate the two regions. Efforts to hold peace talks between the communities by federal and state officials have so far failed to end the conflict.",2025-02-13T15:40:34.619Z,Nikhil Inamdar
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjd4z9d2ymo,Japan truck found in pipe weeks after falling in sinkhole,"A truck cabin that was swallowed by a sinkhole in Japan two weeks ago has been located in a nearby sewer pipe, authorities say. Drone images suggest that a human body is inside the cabin, but it is unclear if it is that of the truck's missing 74-year-old driver. The sinkhole, which now measures 40m (131ft) in diameter, opened at a road intersection in Yashio city near Tokyo. It is believed to be caused by a sewer rupture. Search teams are unable to enter the 5m-wide pipe due to continuous water flow and high levels of hydrogen sulfide or sewer gas, officials said. They will need to install a temporary bypass pipe to stop the water flow and access the truck. That process could take three months, Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono said. While rescuers were able to pull the truck's loading platform from the sinkhole, they were unable to reach the cabin which had the driver. The driver was able to communicate with rescuers shortly after he fell into the sinkhole on 28 January, but contact was lost as the truck was buried deeper in soil and debris. On Sunday, authorities moved their search from the sinkhole to the nearby sewer pipe, where part of a driver's seat was found. The sinkhole initially measured 10m wide and 5m deep, but it has since quadrupled in size after it merged with another sinkhole nearby. As the crater continues to erode, authorities have asked nearby residents to evacuate their homes, fearing further cave-ins. Officials have also asked 1.2 million residents in Saitama prefecture to reduce their water usage, including cutting back on showers and laundry, to limit the water flowing in the underground pipes. The water flow and further road collapses have hampered the search operation, which was suspended more than once out of safety concerns. Sinkholes are increasingly common in Japanese cities, as many have ageing sewage pipeline infrastructure. Officials say that it could take two or three years to repair the sewer rupture.",2025-02-12T07:07:13.273Z,Koh Ewe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceve1xpdjxro,'Ineffective' generic drugs fuel rare public anger in China,"Public anger in China over concerns raised by doctors that generic drugs used in public hospitals are increasingly ineffective has led to a rare response from the government. Doctors say they believe the country's drug procurement system, which incentivises the use of cheap generic drugs over original brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to costs being cut at the expense of people's safety. But officials, quoted by multiple state media outlets on Sunday, say the issue is one of perception rather than reality. One report said different people simply had different reactions to medicines and that claims about them being ineffective had ""mostly come from people's anecdotes and subjective feelings"". The official response has done little to allay public fears over the reputation of drugs in public hospitals and pharmacies. It is the latest challenge to a healthcare system that is already under enormous strain because of a rapidly ageing population. The debate surrounding the use of generic drugs began in December, when authorities announced the list of nearly 200 companies that had won contracts to sell medicines to Chinese state hospitals. Almost all were domestic makers of generic pharmaceuticals. This intensified in January, when, in a video interview that went viral, the director of a hospital department in Shanghai, shared his concerns about the drug procurement system. Zheng Minhua cited ""antibiotics that cause allergies, blood pressure that won't go down, anaesthetised patients who won't sleep"" and laxatives that did not clear the bowel as being among the issues that had been encountered. Dr Zheng's words immediately struck a chord and have been condensed into a social media slogan that has been viewed by millions in the past month - though much of the discussion of the topic has since been censored on Weibo. Many people have come forward to share their own bad experiences with alleged substandard drugs. ""I underwent intestinal surgeries in 2024, which required me to consume laxatives beforehand,"" one Weibo user wrote. They said the drugs they were given had ""no effect whatsoever"", even after the dose was doubled, and that they had to turn to drinking coffee to help clear their bowel. The concerns raised over the efficacy of generic drugs has caused distrust and made some people unwilling to use them. A person on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app, said that when hospital doctors prescribed them the generic version of an antibiotic, they immediately went online to buy the ""original"" ""real"" one, since the generic version ""tasted different"". ""There have been many people catching colds recently. A lot of them might have bought this drug. Quickly send reminders to your friends now and get them to check the brand before buying,"" the user warned. Some of the most popular posts discussing the procurement controversy have been taken down, though it is unclear by whom. China's heavily monitored internet has a strong culture of censorship by both authorities and users themselves. In a scathing, now-removed post by popular podcast host Meng Chang, he lambasted the lack of imported drugs in the public sector: ""If this isn't a bottom line, I don't know what is."" Public anger has also been focussed on the difficulties of accessing imported drugs that people believe to be of better quality. In response to authorities' attempt to reassure people of the quality of generic drugs, one Weibo user wrote: ""As long as we are allowed to buy brand-name drugs ourselves, I have no other complaints."" It was introduced in 2018 as a way to lower state expenditure on medicines and involves local governments putting out tender processes for around 70% of state hospitals' annual drug requirements. Various drug manufacturers then compete to offer the lowest prices for drugs to win these lucrative contracts. This gives an advantage to domestically-produced generic drugs, which contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as original patented drugs but are often several times cheaper to make as they do not include the high costs of research and development. China has emerged as one of the world's largest players in the global generic pharmaceutical market, exporting both finished products to consumers abroad and key ingredients to foreign companies. At home, thousands of generic drug manufacturers compete to sell their products at competitive prices in the expanding domestic market. For generic medicines to be eligible for China's procurement process, they have to be tested and determined to be similar enough to the brand-name version of the drug. Beijing has credited the drugs procurement system with saving millions of residents more than $50bn (£40bn) in its first five years. But the procurement process has seen some drug manufacturers offer medicines at incredibly low prices. One of the winning bids last December was an aspirin tablet selling for less than one cent. ""Are drug tablets that cost less than one cent edible?"" became a trending topic on Weibo at the time. ""The manufacturers that win the bids often set prices so low that they may struggle to produce high quality drugs with the correct ingredients, potentially leading to ineffective medications,"" Stacy Zhang, associate professor at NYU Langone Health, told the BBC. She added that while the procurement system ""was not designed to restrict access to imported brand-name drugs"", it may still have ""affected their accessibility"". A proposal submitted by 20 doctors, including Dr Zheng, to Shanghai authorities last month stated that ""there are widespread concerns in the industry that procurement prices are too low, prompting unethical companies to cut corners to reduce costs, affecting the efficacy of drugs"". ""Doctors are helpless because they have no choice, and there is no channel to escalate feedback."" A recent article by Xia Zhimin, a doctor in Hangzhou, has added to the scrutiny. In it, he highlighted what he said was questionable data from the trials of generic drugs on the procurement list - it was identical to the data from the original drug on which it was based. Dr Xia suggested that it could be evidence of fraud. The National Medical Products Administration responded by saying his findings were due to an ""editorial error"". His article has since been removed. Adding to quality concerns are counterfeit drugs, which have seeped into both generic and brand-name drugs markets across the world and are notoriously difficult to detect. The World Health Organization has described this a global health problem. ""To enhance affordability, the introduction of cost-effective generics is essential,"" Kevin Lu, associate professor at the University of South Carolina's College of Pharmacy, told the BBC. He added that the procurement process needed ""strengthened quality control"" and ""continued improvements in drug approval and manufacturing standards"". The controversy comes at a time when China's healthcare system is already under mounting pressure. A rapidly ageing population has meant that the country's total health expenditure has increased nearly 20-fold over the last 20 years, reaching 9 trillion yuan ($1.25 trillion; £1 trillion) in 2023. Across the country, public medical insurance funds are running thin. Deficits have already appeared in some provinces, where local governments that had relied heavily on land sales for revenue are now struggling with debt as a real estate crisis engulfs China's economy. At the same time, the healthcare system has been experiencing a trust crisis. Violent attacks against medical staff have risen since the 2000s, fuelled by anger at the lack of resources and an erosion of faith in doctors. Unlike issues that have been deemed politically sensitive and heavily censored by authorities, such as the persecution of political dissidents or the suppression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the ongoing controversy surrounding the procurement of drugs has at least been acknowledged by the state as a problem to be tackled. The National Healthcare Security Administration said in a statement on 19 January that authorities ""attached great importance"" to these safety concerns and would seek feedback on the drug procurement policy. ""It is undeniable that the national centralised procurement is still in its infancy. There are many pharmaceutical companies with varying production quality,"" state media Life Times quoted a public health scholar as saying. Other experts cited in the article called for drug evaluation standards to be improved. As authorities try to remedy the procurement system's faltering image, all the scrutiny is now overshadowing a system designed to be a win-win: saving lives and also saving money. As one Weibo user argued, the savings from lower drug prices are but ""a drop in a bucket"" of China's national healthcare costs. On the other hand, they wrote, allowing potentially defective drugs to be widely used is akin to ""drinking poison to quench thirst"".",2025-02-11T22:49:48.223Z,Koh Ewe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwjy18v4go,Teacher fatally stabs eight-year-old in South Korea,"A teacher has fatally stabbed an eight-year-old girl at an elementary school in South Korea, in an incident that has shocked the nation. The female teacher, who is in her 40s, confessed to stabbing the student in the central city of Daejeon, police said. The girl was found with stab wounds on the second floor of a school building at 18:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday and was pronounced dead at hospital. The teacher was found beside her with stab wounds that police said may have been self-inflicted. South Korea's acting president Choi Sang-mok ordered an investigation into the case on Tuesday and urged authorities to ""implement necessary measures to ensure such incidents never happen again"". Some locals laid flowers and a stuffed doll at the gate of the school, which was closed on Tuesday. In a police briefing, Yook Jong-myung, head of the Dajeon Western Police Station, said the teacher was currently recovering in hospital, adding that she had a wound on her neck that had been stitched. The Daejeon education office earlier said the teacher had requested a six-month leave of absence citing depression on 9 December, but had returned to school just 20 days later after a doctor assessed her as being fit to work. During her time off she had suicidal thoughts, Mr Yook said, citing testimony the teacher had provided to police. Days before the stabbing, the teacher had displayed violent behaviour, including putting another teacher in a headlock, the education office said. Two officials from the education office had visited the school on Monday - the morning of the stabbing - to investigate that earlier altercation. After the attack on the co-worker, the education office recommended that the teacher be put on leave and be separated physically from the other teacher. She was made to sit beside the vice principal's desk so that she could be kept under close watch. She had also not been teaching any classes since her leave in December, and did not have any contact with the eight-year-old student, the official said. According to the testimony given by the teacher to police, she was ""annoyed"" that she had not been able to return to teaching a class. She told them she had purchased a weapon on the day of the attack and brought it to school - adding that she had planned to kill herself along with a child. The testimony went on to say that the teacher did not care which child it was, and targeted the last to leave. She managed to ""lure the child into the media room"" before attacking them, it said. The student was reported missing on Monday evening, after a bus driver informed the school that she had not arrived to be picked up that day. South Korea is a generally safe country with strict gun control laws. But in recent years, it has grappled with several high-profile crimes, including stabbings. ""It pains me to see such incidents because a school should be our safest space,"" said acting President Choi. ""I offer my deep condolences to the victim's family who suffered great shock and agony.""",2025-02-11T16:01:05.955Z,Koh Ewe
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y2877051o,Salvador Dalí art comes to India for the first time,"Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí never visited India, an exhibition of his artworks is being held in the country for the first time. Starting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings. The collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dalí's friend and publisher. ""Dalí was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s,"" Ms Argillet told the BBC. Some of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests. Dalí's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style. In his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye. ""Appreciating Dalí's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,"" Ms Argillet says. Bringing Dalí's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition. ""The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,"" Ms Aggarwal says. Strictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dalí's creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist. In 1967, Dalí famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers. In return, Dalí demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed. She finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dalí had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out). Dalí's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality. Born in Spain in 1904, Dalí grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and André Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dalí. The surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by André Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was ""dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason"", according to Breton. Dalí was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges. Consequently, Dalí's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind. ""Dalí was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,"" Ms Argillet says. The artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dalí revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache. ""Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,"" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache. In the same interview, he described his moustache as being ""very gay, very pointed, very aggressive"". Ms Argillet, who knew Dalí intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dalí being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and ""shocking the bourgeois"". He once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover. ""At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,"" Ms Argillet says. But she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dalí's shyness that made him over-perform in public. ""He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dalí, just like his paintings,"" Ms Argillet says. ""The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dalí."" The exhibition 'Dali comes to India' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March. This article has been updated to reflect that two Dali colour etchings are at Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city.",2025-02-11T13:58:19.135Z,Cherylann Mollan
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwx9942x72o,"India sees huge spike in hate speech in 2024, says report","Instances of hate speech against minorities jumped 74% in India in 2024, peaking during the country's national elections, according to a new report. The report, released on Monday by Washington-based research group India Hate Lab, documented 1,165 such instances last year, adding that politicians like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were among the most frequent purveyors of hate speech. Muslims were targeted the most, with 98.5% of recorded instances of hate speech directed against them. The report said most of the events where hate speech occurred were held in states governed by Modi's party or larger alliance. The BBC has sought comment on the India Hate Lab report from several spokespersons at Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Over the years, BJP leaders have often been accused of targeting India's minority communities, especially Muslims. The ruling party has rejected allegations of Islamophobia and hate speech levelled at it by rights groups and opposition leaders. On Tuesday, its national spokesperson reiterated this stance, telling CNN that the country had a ""very strong legal system which is structured to maintain peace, order and ensure non-violence at any cost"". ""Today's India does not need any certification from any 'anti-India reports industry' which is run by vested interests to prejudice and dent India's image,"" Jaiveer Shergill said. But the party was accused of using hate speech during the heated election campaign last year. The prime minister himself was accused of using divisive rhetoric that attacked Muslims. In May, India's Election Commission also asked the party to remove a social media post that opposition leaders said ""demonised Muslims"". According to the India Hate Lab report, 269 hate speech instances were reported in May 2024, the highest in the year. Christians have also been targeted by hate speech, but to a lesser extent than Muslims, the report says. Rights groups have often said that minorities, especially Muslims, have faced increased discrimination and attacks after Modi's government came to power in 2014. The BJP has repeatedly denied these allegations. The lab's report said that hate speech was especially observed at political rallies, religious processions, protest marches and cultural gatherings. Most of these events - 931 or 79.9% - took place in states where the BJP directly governed or ruled in coalition. Three BJP-ruled states - Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh - accounted for nearly half of the total hate speech events recorded in 2024, the lab's data showed. The ruling party was also the organiser for 340 such events in 2024, a 580% increase from the previous year. ""Hate speech patterns in 2024 also revealed a deeply alarming surge in dangerous speech compared to 2023, with both political leaders and religious figures openly inciting violence against Muslims,"" the report said. ""This included calls for outright violence, calls to arms, the economic boycott of Muslim businesses, the destruction of Muslim residential properties and the seizing or demolition of Muslim religious structures.""",2025-02-11T11:56:46.344Z,"Meryl Sebastian, BBC News, Kochi"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20p0pj931o,Syrians describe terror as Alawite families killed in their homes,"Syria's interim leader has appealed for unity, as violence and revenge killings continued in areas loyal to ousted former leader Bashar al-Assad on Sunday. Hundreds of people have reportedly fled their homes in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus - strongholds of Assad support. Local residents have described scenes of looting and mass killings, including of children. In Hai Al Kusour, a predominantly Alawite neighbourhood in the coastal city of Banias, residents say the streets are filled with scattered bodies, piled up and covered in blood. Men of different ages were shot dead there, witnesses said. The Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam and makes up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni Muslim. Assad belongs to the sect. People were too scared to even look out of their windows on Friday. The internet connection is unstable, but when connected they learned of their neighbours' deaths from Facebook posts. One man, Ayman Fares, told the BBC he was saved by his recent imprisonment. He had posted a video on his Facebook account in August 2023 criticising Assad for his corrupt rule. He was arrested soon after, and only released when Islamist-led forces freed prisoners after Assad's fall last December. The fighters who raided the streets of Hai Al Kusour recognised him, so he was spared death but not the looting. They took his cars and continued to raid other houses. ""They were strangers, I can't identify their identity or language, but they seemed to be Uzbek or Chechen,"" Mr Fares told me by phone. ""There were also some Syrians with them but not from the official security. Some civilians also were among those who carried out the killing,"" he added. Mr Fares said he saw families killed in their own homes, and women and children covered in blood. Some families ran to their rooftops to hide but were not spared the bloodshed. ""It is horrific,"" he said. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented more than 740 civilians killed in the coastal cities of Latakia, Jableh and Banias. A further 300 members of the security forces and remnants of the Assad regime are reported to have died in clashes. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the death toll. Mr Fares said things stabilised when the Syrian army and security forces arrived in the city of Banias. They pushed other factions out of the city and provided corridors for families to access safe areas, he said. Ali, another resident of Banias who asked us not to use his full name, corroborated Mr Fares' account. Ali, who lived in Kusour with his wife and 14-year-old daughter, fled his home with the assistance of security forces. ""They came to our building. We were too scared just listening to the fire and screams of people in the neighbourhood. We learned about the deaths from sporadic Facebook posts when we managed to connect. But when they came to our building, we thought we are done,"" he said. ""They were after money. They knocked on our neighbour's door taking his car, his money and all the gold or valuables he had in his home. But he was not killed."" Ali and his family were picked up by his Sunni neighbours, who follow a different branch of Islam, and are now staying with them. ""We lived together for years, Alawites, Sunnis and Christians. We never experienced this,"" he told me. ""The Sunnis rushed to protect Alawites from the killing that happened and now the official forces are in town to restore order."" Ali said families were taken to a school in a neighbourhood that is predominantly Sunni, where they will be protected until members of the factions that carried out the killings are ousted from Banias. The violence started on Thursday after Assad loyalists - who refused to give up arms - ambushed security forces around the coastal cities of Latakia and Jableh, killing dozens of them. Ghiath Dallah, an ex-brigadier general in Assad's army, has announced a new rebellion against the current government, saying he was establishing the ""Military Council for the Liberation of Syria"". Some reports suggest that former security officers of the Assad regime who refused to give up arms are forming a resistance group in the mountains. Mr Fares said most of the Alawite community reject them and blame Dallah and other hardline Assad loyalists for the violence. ""They benefit from the bloodshed that's happening. What we need now is official security to prevail and to prosecute the killers from the factions who did the mass killing so the country restores safety,"" he said. But others also blame interim president Ahmad al-Sharaa, saying he dismantled Syria's security, army and police establishments with no clear strategy for dealing with thousands of officers and personnel left unemployed. Some of these individuals, especially among the police, had nothing to do with the killing during Assad's regime. The new authorities also dismissed thousands of public employees from their work. With 90% of Syria's population living below the poverty line and thousands left without an income, it's fertile ground for a rebellion. There is a split in views in Syria over what is happening. The wider community condemns the killing of any civilians and demonstrations have been organised in Damascus to mourn the deaths and condemn the violence. But over the past two days, there were also calls for ""Jihad"" in different parts of Syria. Residents in Banias said that along with the factions, there were some civilians who were armed and joined forces in the killing. Syria's majority Sunnis have faced atrocities at the hands of the Assad regime's forces over the past 13 years. This fuelled sectarian hatred mainly towards the Alawite minority, where members of the community are affiliated with war crimes. According to human rights groups, there is evidence that Alawite security officers were involved in the killing and torture of thousands of Syrians, the majority of which are Sunni Muslims, during the Assad regime. Those members of the army and security forces who were killed are mostly from the Sunni community and now some in the Sunni community are calling for retaliation, but the president has called for calm. Sharaa, whose Islamist forces toppled Assad three months ago, must now balance providing safety for all with pursuing justice for the crimes of the Assad regime and its henchmen. While he has authority over some of the troops who helped him to power, some factions are clearly out of his control. Those factions also include foreign fighters with a radical Islamist agenda. To lead Syria into a safe and democratic future, many argue Sharaa needs to end the presence of any foreign fighters and deliver a constitution that protects the rights of all Syrians, regardless of their background or religion. While he is seen to be working towards the legal framework for such a constitution, controlling the violent factions and expelling foreign fighters will prove a major challenge.",2025-03-09T16:27:09.999Z,Lina Sinjab
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crknjgrd3geo,Syria leader vows to hunt down those responsible for bloodshed,"Syria's leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to hold anyone involved in harming civilians accountable after days of clashes where Syrian security forces allegedly killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite religious minority. A UK-based monitor said 830 civilians were killed in ""massacres"" targeting Alawites on the west coast on Friday and Saturday. The BBC has been unable to independently verify the death toll of the violence, which is believed to be the worst since the fall of the Assad regime. In a speech broadcast on national TV and posted on social media, Sharaa, whose rebel movement toppled Bashar al-Assad in December, also promised to hunt down Assad loyalists. The fighting has also killed 231 members of the security forces and 250 pro-Assad fighters, according to the monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), taking the overall death toll to 1,311. ""Today, as we stand at this critical moment, we find ourselves facing a new danger - attempts by remnants of the former regime and their foreign backers to incite new strife and drag our country into a civil war, aiming to divide it and destroy its unity and stability,"" the interim president said on Sunday. ""We affirm that we will hold accountable, firmly and without leniency, anyone who is involved in the bloodshed of civilians or harming our people, who overstepped the powers of the state or exploits authority to achieve his own ends,"" Sharaa added in the video speech, posted by state news agency Sana. ""No-one will be above the law and anyone whose hands are stained with the blood of Syrians will face justice sooner rather than later."" Earlier on Sunday, he announced on Telegram that an ""independent committee"" had been formed to ""investigate the violations against civilians and identify those responsible for them"". He also appealed for national unity but did not comment directly on accusations that atrocities were being committed by his supporters in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous. ""God willing, we will be able to live together in this country,"" he said in an separate address from a Damascus mosque. A Syrian security source said the pace of fighting had slowed around the cities of Latakia, Jabla and Baniyas on Sunday, according to Reuters. The violence of recent days has been sparked after ambushes on government forces on Thursday. A Syrian defence ministry spokesman described it to the Sana state news agency as ""treacherous attacks"" against security personnel. It has since escalated into a wave of clashes between Assad loyalists and government forces. Hundreds of Syrians gathered in Damascus to protest against the deadly violence in the country. Demonstrators congregated in Marjeh Square - also known as Martyrs' Square - with placards on Sunday. Amid the fighting, hundreds of civilians living along the Mediterranean coast have fled their homes. The provinces of Latakia and Tartous were former heartlands of deposed president Bashar al-Assad, who also belongs to the Alawite minority. Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni Muslim. The violence has left the Alawite community in ""a state of horror"", an activist in Latakia told the BBC on Friday. Large crowds sought refuge at a Russian military base at Hmeimim in Latakia, according to the Reuters news agency. Video footage shared by Reuters showed dozens of people chanting ""people want Russian protection"" outside the base. Meanwhile, local media reported dozens of families had also fled to neighbouring Lebanon. The UN's special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, said he was ""deeply alarmed"" by ""very troubling reports of civilian casualties"" in Syria's coastal areas. He called on all sides to refrain from actions which could ""destabilise"" the country and jeopardise a ""credible and inclusive political transition"". Similarly, the UN human rights chief Volker Türk called the reports ""extremely disturbing"", adding the need for ""prompt, transparent and impartial investigations"" into all the violations. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, described the killings of Alawites in Latakia and Tartous as ""systematic"" and ""extremely dangerous"", and accused Syria's interim government of failing to control the crisis. ""It was expected that after the fall of the Assad government, Syria would face a difficult transition,"" Amani said. ""But the scale of violence now unfolding is unprecedented and deeply troubling."" Iran's government was aligned with Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, which was toppled last December. Assad was ousted after decades of repressive and brutal rule by his family and an almost 14-year-long civil war.",2025-03-09T21:06:50.312Z,Lucy Clarke-Billings and Gabriela Pomeroy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rz0jvvpwwo,European leaders back 'realistic' Arab plan for Gaza,"Leading European nations have said they support an Arab-backed plan for the reconstruction of Gaza that would cost $53 billion (£41 billion) and avoid displacing Palestinians from the territory. The plan, drawn up by Egypt and endorsed by Arab leaders, has been rejected by Israel and by US President Donald Trump, who presented his own vision to turn the Gaza Strip into a ""Middle East Riviera"". On Saturday the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Italy and Britain welcomed the plan, which calls for Gaza to be rebuilt over five years, as ""realistic"". In a statement, they said the proposal promised ""swift and sustainable improvement of the catastrophic living conditions"" for the people of Gaza. The plan calls for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed to the territory. The committee would be responsible for overseeing humanitarian aid and temporarily managing Gaza's affairs under the supervision of the Palestinian Authority. The proposal was drawn up amid growing concern that Gaza's fragile ceasefire deal could collapse after the six-week first phase expired on 1 March. Israel has blocked aid from entering the territory to pressure Hamas to accept a new US proposal for a temporary extension of the truce, during which more hostages held in Gaza would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But Hamas has insisted that the second phase of the ceasefire, which would see the full withdrawal of Israeli troops, should begin as agreed. Israel will send a negotiating team to Qatar on Monday to take part in talks on extending the ceasefire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said. It remains unclear if or when the second phase of the ceasefire agreement will be implemented. But a Hamas spokesman, Abdel Latif al-Qanoua, spoke of ""positive indicators"" for next week's talks. The Arab-backed plan for Gaza's future is an alternative to Trump's idea for the US to take over the territory and resettle its population. Egypt presented the plan at an emergency Arab League summit on Tuesday and it was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. But both the White House and Israeli foreign ministry said it failed to address realities in Gaza. ""Residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance,"" Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for Trump's National Security Council, said late on Tuesday. ""President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,"" the statement added. The statement issued by the four European countries on Saturday said they were ""committed to working with the Arab initiative"" and they appreciated the ""important signal"" the Arab states had sent by developing it. The statement said Hamas ""must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel any more"" and that the four countries ""support the central role for the Palestinian Authority and the implementation of its reform agenda"". Almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people have had to leave their homes since the start of hostilities. Israel began military operations after Hamas's October 2023 attack which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 more taken hostage. Gaza has suffered vast destruction with a huge humanitarian impact. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military action, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and much infrastructure across the strip has been levelled by air strikes.

The two women - an Israeli tourist and an Indian homestay operator - were stargazing with three male tourists near a lake in the city of Hampi, Karnataka, when they were attacked by a group of men on Thursday night, police superintendent Ram Arasiddi told Reuters. Arasiddi said the assailants pushed the men into the Tungabhadra River canal before raping the women. Two of the men, one of them American, survived, and the third man's body was recovered on Saturday morning, he said. ""Five people - two women and three men - were attacked near Sanapur,"" Arasiddi said. ""Two of them are foreigners, an American [man], and another a woman from Israel."" Police have arrested two of the men accused of the attack and an investigation is ongoing, Arasiddi said. Police believe the men followed the group. The US State Department said it was ""aware of reports that a US citizen was among a group of victims of violent crime"" near Hampi. According to witness testimony from one of the women, the group was stargazing near a temple in Sanapur when three men arrived on a motorcycle and asked them where they could get petrol. As one member of the group gave them directions, one of the three men demanded 100 rupees ($1.29) from the tourists. ""Since the homestay operator did not know them, she told them they had no money,"" police said. ""When the men repeatedly insisted, one of the male tourists gave them 20 rupees. ""After that, the three men allegedly started arguing."" The body of one of the male tourists was later found in the Tungabhadra canal in Karnataka's Koppal district. A case has been registered at Gangavathi Rural Police Station under sections related to extortion, robbery, gang rape and attempted murder. The victims are receiving medical treatment at a government hospital, the police said.

The post-Assad era started with high hopes and relative calm but, as Syria remains deeply fractured, many feared that an explosion of tensions was almost inevitable. With the regime gone, putting an end of more than five decades of Assad family rule, rebels arrived in Damascus from Idlib, a region in Syria's north-west that for years was the only opposition-controlled province in the country. The rebels were catapulted into positions once controlled by hand-picked Assad supporters and, led by al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), were in charge of a country devastated by 13 years of civil war. The dismantling of the security apparatus behind the oppressive machine of the Assads, including the country's army and the ruling Baath party, meant the sacking of hundreds of thousands of people. Among them were large numbers of the minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which the Assad family belong. Under the Assads, they held prominent positions. Now, under Sunni Muslim-led authorities, they have lost their power and privilege, and say they have been under attack and discrimination, despite Sharaa's pledges to respect different religious sects. In January, just over a month after Assad's fall, I met a rebel around 30 years old who had recently been appointed as a high-profile security official. In the nearly empty interior ministry headquarters in Damascus, he welcomed me to a room where any sign of the old regime had been removed. Tall and shy, the official made notes on his iPad while acknowledging that the new rulers faced enormous challenges, including resistance by Assad loyalists. He requested anonymity to be able to discuss sensitive issues. ""There are Assad-affiliated people who haven't engaged with the reconciliation process,"" he said, citing the new authorities' call for former members of the security forces to surrender their weapons and ties to the old government. ""Our eyes are on everyone, but we don't want to give the impression that we're after them. That's why there haven't been massive raids."" He also mentioned the threat from Sharaa's more radical supporters, who were frustrated with the pragmatic and conciliatory tone of a man who led al-Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate. Syria's new leader has tried to convince everyone, especially in the West, that he is a reformed man and that his jihadist ideologies remain in the past. ""We recognise that this is a problem,"" the official said, adding: ""we're going to [have to] deal with it."" For weeks, violence against government forces was on the rise, particularly in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous - the Alawite heartland and a stronghold for Assad supporters. An insurgency seemed to be growing but the clashes were relatively contained. Until Thursday. As forces linked to the government carried out an operation in the countryside of Latakia, targeting a former Assad official, they were ambushed by gunmen in Jableh. A regional official described it as a well-planned attack carried out by ""remnants of the Assad militias"", with reports that about 4,000 men were involved. To curb the rebellion, the authorities sent reinforcements, who were also joined by militias who were not necessarily responding to the orders from Damascus. The operation turned into revenge killings of a sectarian nature: after decades of brutality under the Assads in the mainly Sunni country, many associate Alawites with the old regime. A widely shared video showed the bodies of at least two dozen men in civilian clothing, piled in the yard of a house, in the Alawite town of Mukhtareyah. Elsewhere, accounts emerged of fighters searching for Alawite members and killing entire families on the spot. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, more than 1,300 people have been killed in Latakia, Tartous, Hama and Homs provinces, a number that includes 973 civilians and hundreds of members of the Syrian security forces and Assad loyalists. The information could not be independently verified. Sharaa's office announced the creation of an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings by both sides, saying that he would hold to account anyone who overstepped their authority. ""No-one will be above the law,"" he said in a video speech. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based research group, said former Assad regime members were likely to form the most effective insurgent cells against Syria's new rulers with the ability to co-ordinate attacks. ""[They] already have pre-existing networks that they can leverage to rapidly organise insurgent cells. These networks are military, intelligence, and political networks and criminal syndicates who were regime supporters and lost significant economic and political influence in the aftermath of Assad's fall,"" a report said. The bloodshed will add to the pressure on Sharaa, whose forces do not control the whole of Syria, and where myriad factions - supported by different countries - exercise power over different regions. Turkish-backed groups are clashing with Kurdish forces that control large areas in north-east, while Israeli troops are occupying parts of the country's south-west. The authorities have also faced resistance from Druze forces in the south, although a deal was reached last week. However, Sharaa's challenges go beyond the task of trying to keep the country safe. As Western suspicions over his intentions continue, the authorities are struggling to get crippling sanctions imposed on Syria under the former regime lifted, a vital move to revive the economy of a country where nine in every 10 people are in poverty. The recent violence will make those efforts even harder.",2025-03-10T11:57:20.262Z,Hugo Bachega
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1w0l3q4zd0o,"Israel cuts off electricity supply to Gaza, minister says","Israel ordered all of Gaza's electricity supply to be cut off on Sunday in an effort to pressure Hamas into releasing the remaining Israeli hostages held in the territory. Energy minister Eli Cohen's announcement came a week after Israel cut off all aid supplies to the territory, which has a population of more than two million people. In a video statement on Sunday, Cohen said: ""We will use all the tools at our disposal to bring back the hostages and ensure that Hamas is no longer in Gaza the day after [the war]."" The decision to cut electricity is expected to primarily affect the operation of desalination plants, which are crucial for providing clean drinking water. The government said it has not ruled out cutting off water supplies. In his statement, Cohen said: ""I have just signed the order to stop supplying electricity immediately to the Gaza Strip."" Israel cut off most of the mains electricity supply to Gaza earlier in the war. Talks to prolong the fragile ceasefire, the first phase of which ended on 1 March, are expected to resume in Qatar on Monday. Israel wants Hamas to accept an extension of the first phase of their ceasefire. But Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase, which would see the release of the remaining hostages from Gaza, withdrawal of Israeli forces and a permanent end to war. Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages as well as the bodies of 35 others. The militant group - which has warned that cutting off supplies to Gaza would affect the hostages as well - said on Sunday that it had wrapped up the latest round of ceasefire talks with Egyptian mediators without changes to its position and called for an immediate start of the ceasefire's second phase. Gaza's coastal territory and its infrastructure have been largely devastated by the war, and generators and solar panels are used for some of the power supply. Israel has faced criticism over cutting off supplies to Gaza. ""Any denial of the entry of the necessities of life for civilians may amount to collective punishment,"" the United Nations human rights office said on Friday. Hamas has reiterated its support for a proposal for the establishment of an independent committee of technocrats to run Gaza until Palestinians hold presidential and legislative elections. That committee would work under the umbrella of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is based in the occupied West Bank. Israel has rejected the PA having any role in Gaza but has not put forward an alternative for post-war rule. Hamas's attack in October 2023 killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, inside Israel and saw 251 people taken hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",2025-03-09T19:37:38.602Z,Jon Donnison
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ed4qzp4do,Iran criticises 'bullying countries' after Trump letter for nuclear talks,"Iran's Supreme leader has criticised ""bullying"" countries in an apparent response to Donald Trump's letter demanding negotiations over its nuclear programme. Trump said on Friday he had warned Tehran in a letter it could face military action unless it agreed to talks for a nuclear deal. In a furious response on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran would not negotiate with ""bullying governments"" insisting on talks. His regime has rapidly advanced its nuclear programme in recent years, the UN's monitor says. Trump has said he wants to strike a new deal with Iran to prevent it from developing its nuclear programme further. On Friday he said he had offered Iran a chance to negotiate or risk its nuclear programme being targeted. ""I've written them a letter, saying I hope you're going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily it's going to be a terrible thing for them,"" Trump told Fox Business on Friday. ""There are two ways Iran can be handled - militarily, or you make a deal,"" Trump said. ""I would prefer to make a deal, because I am not looking to hurt Iran."" Iran's Ayatollah appeared to respond to Trump's statements in a Ramadan meeting with officials on Saturday, reported by local media. Khamenei did not name the US but said ""some bully governments insist on negotiations."" ""Their negotiations are not aimed at solving problems, they aim at domination,"" he said according to Iranian media. ""The issue is not just the nuclear issue.They are setting new expectations that these new expectations will definitely not be met on the part of Iran."" In December, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog said Iran's decision to begin producing significantly more highly enriched uranium was ""very worrisome"". Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Iran was increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, just below the level of purity needed for a nuclear weapon. Tehran has denied accusation it is building nuclear weapons, emphasising instead that its programme has peaceful aims. Iran had previously agreed to limits on its nuclear programme under the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, an agreement signed with the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany in return for sanctions relief. But during his first term in office, Trump withdrew the US from the deal and reinstated US sanctions on Iran. In the years since the collapse of the deal, Iran has accelerated its nuclear programme, accelerating its enrichment of uranium. It now has stocks that are near weapons grade, analysts say. The conflicts in the Middle East this past year have also heightened nuclear tensions. President Trump has said he would give Israel the the green light to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, after Israel and Iran exchanged attacks last year linked to the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Iran's air defence systems - which protect its nuclear facilities - were damaged in Israeli strikes on military targets. Iran's government is also under economic pressure from Western sanctions and has seen nationwide protests during the past few years over both social and economic grievances. Iran is due to hold annual joint naval drills with Russia and China on Monday, in the Iranian port of Chabahar.",2025-03-09T09:56:03.718Z,Gabriela Pomeroy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mwln4p87do,Trump issues 'last warning' to Hamas as US confirms direct hostage talks,"US President Donald Trump has issued what he called a ""last warning"" to Hamas to release the hostages being held in Gaza. ""I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don't do as I say,"" Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform. Hamas accused the US president of encouraging Israel to break the ceasefire deal currently in effect between the two sides. Trump's statement came just hours after the White House confirmed it was holding direct talks with Hamas over the remaining hostages. Washington has until now avoided direct engagement with the group, and there is a longstanding US policy against having direct contact with entities it lists as terrorist organisations. In his social media post, Trump said there would be ""hell to pay"" if the hostages were not released, while not specifying the nature of the support he was sending Israel. ""Release all of the hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,"" he added. ""For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance."" He also appeared to issue a wider threat: ""Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD!"" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement that such threats ""complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation [Israel] to avoid implementing its terms"". It's not the first time Trump has threatened Hamas. In December, he said there would be ""all hell to pay"" if hostages were not released by the time he took office. The post came after Trump met with a group of hostages in the White House who had been recently released under the ceasefire. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the US has been negotiating directly with Hamas to try to secure the release of the hostages. Israel had been consulted prior to the talks, she added. President Trump believed in doing what was in the best interest of the American people, Leavitt told reporters. The work of the special envoy for hostages, Adam Boehler, work was a ""good faith effort to do what's right for the American people"", she added. ""Two direct meetings"" have taken place between Hamas and a US official, ""preceded by several communications"", a Palestinian source told the BBC. News of the talks was first reported by Axios, which said the two sides were meeting in Qatar to discuss the release of US hostages as well as a wider deal to end the war. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,440 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says there are still 59 hostages being held in Gaza, with up to 24 believed to be alive. Five US citizens are among the captives. One of them, Edan Alexander, is believed to be alive and the other four are presumed dead. A former US deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for the Middle East said the US needs to be ""more proactive"" about getting its citizens back. Mick Mulroy, who is also an ex-CIA paramilitary officer, added that ""it could complicate the Israelis' ability to get their citizens back if not tightly coordinated"". Israel's prime minister's office said in a statement it has ""expressed its position"" regarding the direct talks, but did not provide any further information. According to reports, Boehler met with Hamas representatives in the Qatari capital, Doha, in recent weeks. Hamas has had a base in Doha since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration. The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia. Alongside the US and Egypt, Qatar has also played a major role in talks to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7vd4pnxx3o,US and Israel reject Arab alternative to Trump's Gaza plan,"The US and Israel have rejected an Arab plan for the post-war reconstruction of the Gaza Strip that would allow the 2.1 million Palestinians living there to stay in place. The proposal, endorsed by Arab leaders at a summit in Cairo, is their alternative to President Donald Trump's idea for the US to take over Gaza and permanently resettle its population. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas welcomed the Arab plan, which calls for Gaza to be governed temporarily by a committee of independent experts and for international peacekeepers to be deployed there. But both the White House and Israeli foreign ministry said it failed to address realities in Gaza and stood by Trump's vision. The summit took place amid growing concern that Gaza's fragile ceasefire deal could collapse after the six-week first phase expired last Saturday. Israel has blocked aid from entering the territory to pressure Hamas to accept a new US proposal for a temporary extension of the truce, during which more hostages held in Gaza would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has insisted the second phase should begin as agreed, leading to an end of the war and a full Israeli troop withdrawal. The $53bn (£41bn) Arab plan for rebuilding Gaza once the war ends was presented by Egypt at an emergency Arab League summit on Tuesday. A statement endorsing the plan stressed ""the categorical rejection of any form of displacement of the Palestinian people"", describing such an idea as ""a gross violation of international law, a crime against humanity and ethnic cleansing"". The plan envisages reconstruction taking place over three phases and taking five years, during which some 1.5 million displaced Gazans would be moved into 200,000 prefabricated housing units and 60,000 repaired homes. In the first phase, which would last six months and cost $3bn, millions of tonnes of rubble and any unexploded ordnance would be cleared. The second phase, lasting two years and costing $20bn, would see housing and utilities rebuilt. An airport, two seaports and an industrial zone would be built during the third phase, which would take another two years and cost $30bn. The Arab plan also proposes that an ""administrative committee"" made up of independent Palestinian technocrats run post-war Gaza for a transitional period while ""working towards empowering the Palestinian Authority to return"". Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and others - took full control of Gaza in 2007, ousting forces from the Fatah-dominated PA in violent clashes a year after winning parliamentary elections. The PA was left governing parts of the occupied West Bank. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the PA, told the summit that he welcomed the Arab plan and urged Donald Trump to support it. Hamas said it appreciated ""the Arab position rejecting attempts to displace our people"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any future role in Gaza for Hamas or the PA. However, Israel's foreign ministry swiftly rejected the Arab League's statement endorsing the Egyptian plan, saying it ""fails to address the realities of the situation following 7 October 2023, remaining rooted in outdated perspectives"". ""Now, with President Trump's idea, there is an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will. This should be encouraged!"" it added. ""Instead, Arab states have rejected this opportunity, without giving it a fair chance, and continue to level baseless accusations against Israel."" White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said the Arab plan did ""not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance."" ""President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region."" Trump proposed last month that the US would ""own"" Gaza and relocate its population, so that it could be rebuilt and turned into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"". He said the displaced Palestinians would have no right of return because they would have ""much better housing"" in Egypt, Jordan and other countries. The Assistant Secretary General of the Arab League, Hossam Zaki, told the BBC on Wednesday that Trump's approach was unacceptable. ""It is based on the forced displacement of Palestinians out of their homes and of their land. This is against international law and, we have said this time and again, this is not a way to treat this man-made crisis,"" he said. ""This is a war that has been waged by Israel partly with the aim of driving Palestinians out of their territory,"" he added. He also described the Israeli foreign ministry's response to the Arab plan as ""against humanity and against morals"". Palestinians fear a repeat of the Nakba - the Arabic word for ""catastrophe"" - when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Many of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three-quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the West Bank, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,400 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",2025-03-05T12:53:39.297Z,David Gritten
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jpw5p5e6go,Gaza food prices soar after Israel halts aid deliveries,"Food prices in Gaza have risen sharply and aid food parcels could soon run out after Israel blocked the entry of humanitarian aid, the UN's humanitarian agency said. OCHA's partners reported that flour and vegetable prices had more than doubled in some cases, with Gazans telling the BBC the same. If the blockade continued, ""at least 80 community kitchens may soon run out of stock"" and remaining food parcels that ""will support 500,000 people, will soon run out"", OCHA said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chose to stop aid at the weekend, accusing Hamas of stealing supplies and refusing a US proposal to extend the Gaza ceasefire. A Hamas spokesman said the halt was ""cheap blackmail"". The foreign ministers of France, Germany and the UK issued a joint statement on Wednesday calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza ""catastrophic"" and expressing deep concern at Israel's action. ""A halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza, such as that announced by the government of Israel would risk violating international humanitarian law,"" the statement read. ""Humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool."" The ministers said it was vital that the ceasefire was sustained, all hostages held by Hamas were released, and continued flows of aid were ensured. Thousands of aid trucks had surged into Gaza each week under the ceasefire deal that started on 19 January. After the ceasefire's first phase expired on Saturday night, Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of stealing aid ""to finance its terror machine"". Hamas has previously denied stealing humanitarian aid in Gaza. Netanyahu also said Hamas was refusing to accept a six-week ceasefire extension, under different terms from those previously agreed, as proposed by US President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff. After the halt of aid in response, OCHA said on Tuesday that some community kitchens which remain operational ""will need to start to adjust meal content or reduce the number of meals prepared to cope with anticipated shortages"". Partners would also ""be forced to reduce food rations"". While they are distributing previously dispatched food parcels, remaining supplies are expected to run out. Abu Qais Aryan, from Khan Younis, told BBC Arabic the cost of basic goods doubled over Sunday night. Prices had already doubled or tripled since the war began, he said. Other residents said the price of a 1kg (2.2lb) of tomatoes rose overnight from five shekels ($1.38; £1.07) to 10, and a 1kg of cucumbers from six to 17 shekels. ""We could barely afford to buy a kilo of tomatoes just to satisfy our hunger,"" said one man, Issam, adding that people could not buy food ""because there is no cash liquidity"". Issa Meit, from Gaza City, said there was a shortage of goods and very high consumption, and he was ""very afraid that prices will increase again"". ""The recent decision is unfair as it wrongs our children. How will our children live in light of these high prices that will increase in an arbitrary way?"" he said. Some blamed merchants for hiking prices, saying they were exploiting the situation. Merchant Mahmoud Abu Mohsen told BBC Arabic he raised prices because the wholesalers he purchases from did as well. ""For example, I used to buy sugar for five shekels, three shekels, or four shekels, but now I buy sugar for six shekels, meaning I don't make more than a small profit,"" he said. ""The news that Netanyahu announced is what caused a stir among the people."" A spokeswoman for Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Caroline Seguin, told the BBC on Wednesday that in Gaza City, the price of just over 2lb (900g) of sugar had risen from just over $1 (78p) to $5. In Khan Younis and Gaza City, the cost of a carton of 30 eggs had shot up around 150%, she added. ""The news has created uncertainty and fear, causing food prices to spike,"" Ms Seguin said in an earlier statement. ""Israel is once again blocking an entire population from receiving aid, using it as a bargaining chip. This is unacceptable, outrageous, and will have devastating consequences."" Qatar and Egypt, which helped mediate the ceasefire along with the US, condemned Israel's move. Qatar's foreign ministry called the decision ""a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement"" and ""international humanitarian law"" in a statement. Egypt's foreign ministry accused Israel of using starvation as ""a weapon against the Palestinian people"". Israeli government spokesman David Mencer said in a video briefing that ""Hamas has hoarded for months and months of supplies. They have enough food to fuel an obesity epidemic."" ""The supplies are there but Hamas doesn't share,"" he added. A month ago, OCHA said more than a million people - roughly half of Gaza's population - had received food assistance since the ceasefire began. All aid, not just food, is affected by the blockade. Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said that inside Gaza, it had some medicine in reserve for its clinics and assistive devices for people with disabilities, in addition to hygiene kits. ""However, we don't currently have high aid reserves as most items entering were for immediate distribution,"" the charity said. Ms Seguin said even though it appeared MSF's medical supplies would last for a few months, ""it doesn't mean that we haven't been consistently running short of essentials"". The main concern for the health system, she said, was fuel for generators at hospitals to ensure ventilators and other critical medical equipment continued to work. She said ""the consequences will be at the cost of the people in Gaza"". The ceasefire aimed to end 15 months of conflict, which erupted after Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel responded with an air and ground campaign in Gaza that killed at least 48,405 people, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2025-03-05T16:29:53.997Z,Mallory Moench
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj92w2j7ny0o,"Indian killed in Jordan was victim of job scam, family say","The family of an Indian man who was shot dead while illegally crossing into Israel say he was a victim of a job scam. Thomas Gabriel Perera was killed by Jordanian security forces by the border with Israel on 10 February. He was lured to Jordan by the promise of a lucrative job, and when it did not materialise he tried to enter Israel as he was told he could find work there, his family told the BBC. Reports of Indians falling for employment scams and illegally entering other countries to look for work have become increasingly common. Perera, 47, had been accompanied by his brother-in-law Edison Charlas, who was injured in the incident. Mr Charlas was treated in hospital and spent a fortnight in prison before he was repatriated to India. The two men were from the southern Indian state of Kerala where they worked as auto-rickshaw drivers. An agent had promised them they could get blue-collar jobs in Jordan earning 350,000 rupees ($4,000; £3,110) a month. Mr Charlas told the BBC he paid 210,000 rupees to an agent before they left India, and paid an additional $600 after reaching Jordan on a tourist visa. But when the two men arrived in Jordan's capital city Amman in early February, they were told by the agent that there were no jobs available. The agent then suggested they should try illegally crossing into Israel, claiming there were plenty of opportunities there. On 10 February, Mr Charlas and Perera joined a group that drove for hours to Jordan's border with Israel. ""We were taken in a car. It was a long distance. We got into the car at 2pm and reached the location only around midnight. Then we were made to walk several kilometres along a coastline. It was while walking in the dark that we were shot,'' said Mr Charlas. The BBC has seen a letter sent to Perera's family by the Indian embassy in Jordan. It states that ""security forces tried to stop them but they did not listen to the warning, the guards opened fire on them"". ""One bullet hit Mr Thomas [Perera] in his head and he passed away on the spot.'' Mr Charlas, however, disputed this account and said there was ""no such warning (from the guards). They just shot.'' ""I was walking slowly behind the others in the dark... That was when the bullet hit me and I lost consciousness. I had no clue what happened to Thomas,'' he said. The BBC has asked India's foreign ministry and Jordanian authorities for comment on Mr Charlas' allegation. Mr Charlas said he was later taken to a hospital for treatment and then moved between several Jordanian government offices before being transferred to prison, where he was kept for 18 days. While in prison, he managed to contact his wife and told her what had happened, and his wife contacted Indian embassy officials. Mr Charlas was deported to India on 28 February. Perera's body is still in Jordan. In response to BBC queries, India's foreign ministry said they were working to bring the body back to India as soon as possible. ""I am told that it will take one or two days for the process of documentation and other things to be completed,"" said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the foreign ministry. On Monday, Shashi Tharoor, the member of parliament representing Perera's constituency Thiruvananthapuram, said that members of the Indian embassy in Jordan had verified the victim's identity and that the process of transportation of the body had begun. Despite numerous government warnings, many Indians are still falling prey to job scams and taking the risk of entering countries illegally to find work, say observers. ""The modus operandi is to get a tourist visa for one country and then enter the neighbouring country,"" said Ajith Kolassery, the CEO of Norka, the Kerala government's department overseeing migration. ""No country will accept illegal entry. We have been consistently issuing advisories to people to be wary of job rackets, but they are still going."" In recent years hundreds of Indians have been rescued from scam centres in Cambodia and other parts of South East Asia. They were trafficked to the centres after they were lured overseas by promises of good jobs. Scores of Indian nationals were also tricked into fighting for Russia in the war with Ukraine after they were offered fake jobs and opportunities to study abroad. The 100 Indians who were deported from the US last month after being accused of entering the country illegally had also been lured by the hope of a better life, pointed out Irudaya Rajan, who chairs the International Institute of Migration and Development in Thiruvananthapuram. ""They also paid money to agents and were cheated. It's the struggle to get better wages [that is driving this],"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w1nzpg5dgo,Sudan takes UAE to world court over 'complicity in genocide',"Sudan is taking the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of supporting Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the civil war. Khartoum argues the UAE is ""complicit in the genocide"" of the Masalit community, in West Darfur, through its military, financial and political backing for the RSF. In response, the UAE has strongly rejected Sudan's allegations, calling the case a ""cynical publicity stunt"", and saying it will seek an immediate dismissal. Since the war began in April 2023, both the RSF and the Sudanese army have been accused of committing atrocities. The RSF has been accused of committing a genocide in Darfur - against the region's non-Arabic groups. According to news agency AFP, Sudan's submission to the ICJ says: ""The United Arab Emirates fuels the rebellion and supports the militia that has committed the crime of genocide in West Darfur. ""The United Arab Emirates must make full reparation for the injury caused (by) its internationally wrongful acts, including paying reimbursement to the victims of the war."" An unnamed UAE official said that ""the allegations presented by the SAF representative at the ICJ lack any legal or factual basis, representing yet another attempt to distract from this calamitous war"".  UN experts monitoring the arms embargo on Darfur have previously described accusations of the UAE smuggling weapons to the RSF through Chad as credible. The ICJ's advisory opinion is not legally binding but still carries significant political weight. The nearly two-year war has devastated Sudan, with tens of thousands killed and over 12 million people displaced, fuelling one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. Earlier this week, heavy shelling on a camp for displaced people in North Dafur left dozens of people feared dead.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wpy14wyd0o,"Party drug MDMA may have protected survivors of Nova attack from trauma, study suggests","As dawn approached on the morning of 7 October 2023, many of the partygoers at the Nova music festival near Gaza's border took illegal recreational drugs like MDMA or LSD. Hundreds of them were high when, shortly after sunrise, Hamas gunmen attacked the site. Now neuroscientists working with survivors from the festival say there are early signs that MDMA - also known as ecstasy or molly - may have provided some psychological protection against trauma. The preliminary results, currently being peer-reviewed with a view to publication in the coming months, suggest that the drug is associated with more positive mental states - both during the event and in the months afterwards. The study, carried out by scientists at Israel's Haifa University, could contribute to a growing scientific interest in how MDMA might be used to treat psychological trauma. It is thought to be the first time scientists have been able to study a mass trauma event where large numbers of people were under the influence of mind-altering drugs. Hamas gunmen killed 360 people and kidnapped dozens more at the festival site where 3,500 people had been partying. ""We had people hiding under the bodies of their friends for hours while on LSD or MDMA,"" said Prof Roy Salomon, one of those leading the research. ""There's talk that a lot of these substances create plasticity in the brain, so the brain is more open to change. But what happens if you endure this plasticity in such a terrible situation - is it going to be worse, or better?"" The research tracked the psychological responses of more than 650 survivors from the festival. Two-thirds of these were under the influence of recreational drugs including MDMA, LSD, marijuana or psilocybin - the compound found in hallucinogenic mushrooms - before the attacks took place. ""MDMA, and especially MDMA that was not mixed with anything else, was the most protective,"" the study has found, according to Prof Salomon. He said those on MDMA during the attack appeared to cope much better mentally in the first five months afterwards, when a lot of processing takes place. ""They were sleeping better, had less mental distress - they were doing better than people who didn't take any substance,"" he said. The team believes pro-social hormones triggered by the drug - such as oxytocin, which helps promote bonding - helped reduce fear and boost feelings of camaraderie between those fleeing the attack. And even more importantly, they say, it appears to have left survivors more open to receiving love and support from their families and friends once they were home. Clearly, the research is limited only to those who survived the attacks, making it hard to determine with any certainty whether specific drugs helped or hindered victims' chances of escape. But researchers found that many survivors, like Michal Ohana, firmly believe it did play a role - and say that belief, in itself, may help them to recover from the event. ""I feel like it saved my life, because I was so high, like I'm not in the real world,"" she told me. ""Because regular humans can't see all these things - it's not normal."" Without the drug, she believes she would have just frozen or collapsed to the floor, and been killed or captured by the gunmen. Clinicians in various countries have already experimented with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a trial setting - though only Australia has approved it as a treatment. Countries that have rejected it include the US, where the Food and Drug Administration cited concerns about the design of the studies, that the treatment may not offer long-lasting benefits, and about the potential risk for heart problems, injury and abuse. MDMA is classified as a Class A drug in the UK, and has been linked to liver, kidney and heart problems. In Israel, where MDMA is also illegal, psychologists can use it to treat clients on an experimental research basis only. The preliminary findings from the Nova study are being closely followed by some of those Israeli clinicians experimenting with MDMA as treatment for PTSD after 7 October. Dr Anna Harwood-Gross, a clinical psychologist and director of research at Israel's Metiv Psychotrauma Centre, described the initial findings as ""really important"" for therapists like her. She is currently experimenting with using MDMA to treat PTSD within the Israeli military, and had worried about the ethics of inducing a vulnerable psychological state in clients when there is a war going on. ""At the beginning of the war, we questioned whether we were able to do this,"" she said. ""Can we give people MDMA when there's a risk of an air raid siren? That's going to re-traumatise them potentially. This study has shown us that even if there's a traumatic event during therapy, the MDMA might also help process that trauma."" Dr Harwood-Gross says early indications of therapeutic MDMA use are encouraging, even among military veterans with chronic PTSD. It has also upended old assumptions about the ""rules"" of therapy - especially the length of sessions, which have to be adjusted when working with clients under the influence of MDMA, she says. ""For example, it's changed our thoughts about 50-minute therapy sessions, with one patient and one therapist,"" Dr Harwood-Gross told me. ""Having two therapists, and long sessions - up to eight hours long - is a new way of doing therapy. They're looking at people very holistically and giving them time."" She says this new longer format is showing promising results, even without patients taking MDMA, with a success rate of 40% in the placebo group. Israeli society itself has also changed its approach to trauma and therapy following the 7 October attacks, according to Danny Brom, a founding director of the METIV Psychotrauma Centre at Herzog Hospital in Jerusalem, and a senior figure in the industry. ""It's as if this is the first trauma we're going through,"" he said. ""I've seen wars here, I've seen lots of terrorist attacks and people said, 'We don't see trauma here'. ""Suddenly, there seems to be a general opinion that now everyone is traumatised, and everyone needs treatment. It's a wrong approach."" What broke, he said, is the sense of security many Jews believed Israel would provide them. These attacks uncovered a collective trauma, he says, linked to the Holocaust and generations of persecution. ""Our history is full of massacres,"" psychologist Vered Atzmon Meshulam told me. ""As a psychologist now in Israel, we are faced with an opportunity to work with lots of traumas that weren't previously being treated, like all our narratives for 2,000 years."" Collective trauma, combat trauma, mind-altering drugs, sexual assault, hostages, survivors, body-collectors, the injured and the bereaved - Israel's trauma specialists are facing a complex cocktail of issues from the clients now flooding into therapy. The scale of that mental health challenge is mirrored in Gaza, where vast numbers of people have been killed, injured or left homeless after a devastating 15-month war - and where there are scant resources to help a deeply traumatised population. The war in Gaza, triggered by the Hamas attacks on Israeli communities in October 2023, was suspended in January in a six-week truce, during which Israeli hostages held by Hamas were exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. But there is little sense on either side that the peace and security needed to begin healing has arrived. The truce expired last weekend, with 59 Israeli hostages still in Hamas captivity. Many Gazans are waiting, with their bags packed, for war to resume. Meanwhile Nova survivor Michal Ohana says she feels that with the passage of time, some are expecting her to have moved on from the attacks, but she is still affected. ""I wake up with this, and I go to sleep with this, and people don't understand,"" she told me. ""We live this every day. I feel the country supported us in the first months, but now after one year, they feel: 'OK, you need to go back to work, back to life.' But we can't.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1vqy4py0o,Gazans face tough choices as their future is debated on the global stage,"The level of destruction in Jabalia when viewed from the air is truly astonishing. A Hiroshima-like wasteland stretches as far as the eye can see. The mangled carcasses of buildings dot the churned-up landscape, some leaning at crazy angles. Great undulating waves of rubble make it all but impossible to make out the geography of this once bustling, tightly packed refugee camp. And yet, as a drone camera flies over the wreckage, it picks out splashes of blue and white where small tent camps have been set up in patches of open ground. And figures, clambering over broken buildings, moving along streets of dirt, where food markets are springing up under tin roofs and canvas awnings. Children using a collapsed roof as a slide. After more than six weeks of Gaza's fragile ceasefire, Jabalia is slowly coming back to life. In the neighbourhood of al-Qasasib, Nabil has returned to a four-storey house that's somehow still standing, even if it lacks windows, doors and - in some places - walls. He and his relatives have made crude balconies out of wooden pallets and strung-up tarpaulin to keep out the elements. ""Look at the destruction,"" he says as he surveys Jabalia's ocean of ruins from a gaping upper floor. ""They want us to leave without rebuilding it? How can we leave. The least we can do is rebuild it for our children."" To cook a meal, Nabil lights a fire on the bare staircase, stoking it carefully with pieces of torn-up cardboard. On another floor, Laila Ahmed Okasha washes up in a sink where the tap ran dry months ago. ""There's no water, electricity or sewage,"" she says. ""If we need water, we have to go to a far place to fill up buckets."" She says she cried when she came back to the house and found it wrecked. She blames Israel and Hamas for destroying the world she once knew. ""Both of them are responsible,"" she says. ""We had a decent, comfortable life."" Soon after the war began in October 2023, Israel told Palestinians in the northern part of the Gaza Strip – including Jabalia – to move south for their own safety. Hundreds of thousands of people heeded the warning, but many stayed, determined to ride out the war. Laila and her husband Marwan clung on until October last year, when the Israeli military reinvaded Jabalia, saying Hamas had reconstituted fighting units inside the camp's narrow streets. After two months of sheltering in nearby Shati camp, Leila and Marwan returned to find Jabalia almost unrecognisable. ""When we came back and saw how it was destroyed, I didn't want to stay here anymore,"" Marwan says. ""I had a wonderful life, but now it's a hell. If I have the chance to leave, I'll go. I won't stay one more minute."" Stay or go? The future of Gaza's civilian population is now the subject of international debate. In February, Donald Trump suggested that the US should take over Gaza and that nearly two million Palestinian residents should leave, possibly for good. Faced with international outrage and fierce opposition from Arab leaders, Trump has subsequently appeared to back away from the plan, saying he recommended it but would not force it on anyone. In the meantime, Egypt has led Arab efforts to come up with a viable alternative, to be presented at an emergency Arab summit in Cairo on Tuesday. Crucially, it says the Palestinian population should remain inside Gaza while the area is reconstructed. Donald Trump's intervention has brought out Gaza's famously stubborn side. ""If Trump wants to make us leave, I'll stay in Gaza,"" Laila says. ""I want to travel on my own free will. I won't leave because of him."" Across the way sits a nine-storey yellow block of flats so spectacularly damaged it's hard to believe it hasn't collapsed. The upper floors have caved in entirely, threatening the rest. In time, it will surely have to be demolished, but for now it's home to yet more families. There are sheets in the windows and washing hanging to dry in the late winter sunshine. Most incongruously of all, outside a makeshift plastic doorway on a corner of the ground floor, next to piles of rubble and rubbish, stands a headless mannequin, wearing a wedding gown. It's Sanaa Abu Ishbak's dress shop. The 45-year-old seamstress, mother of 11, set up the business two years before the war but had to abandon it when she fled south in November 2023. She came back as soon as the ceasefire was announced. With her husband and daughters, she's been busy clearing debris from the shop, arranging dresses on hangers and getting ready for business. ""I love Jabalia camp,"" she says, ""and I won't leave it till I die."" Sanaa and Laila seem equally determined to stay put if they can. But both women speak differently when they talk of the young. ""She doesn't even know how to write her own name,"" Laila says of her granddaughter. ""There's no education in Gaza."" The little girl's mother was killed during the war. Laila says she still talks to her at night. ""She was the soul of my soul and she left her daughter in my hands. If I have the chance to travel, I will do so for the sake of my granddaughter.""",2025-03-04T06:07:13.691Z,Paul Adams
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0w0x28yxo,'We are still at war': Syria's Kurds battle Turkey months after Assad's fall,"To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads. This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces. But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain. As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting. A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014. IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months. Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary. At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).  As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives. But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate. For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. ""Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,"" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. ""It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it."" The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace. Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border. Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border. As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF. Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: ""Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege."" In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years. Newrouz Ahmad says that having ""defeated IS in Kobane… we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too"". At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. ""I am 60,"" he says. It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed. And now the threat of another battle is looming. Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit. In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years. She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing. The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing. The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured. ""An old man next to me was also injured,"" she tells me from her bed. ""I lost some blood… but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,"" she adds. Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an ""apparent war crime"" by the Turkish-SNA coalition. The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that ""reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth"" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a ""conflict-ridden area on purpose"" to use them as ""human shields… in order to not to lose control on the said dam"". It accused the SDF of using ""violence and terror"" to pursue ""its own separatist agenda"", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs. Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place. The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east. But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies – Turkey. And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited. Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before. But the two sides have still not reached an agreement. ""In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,"" he says, adding: ""In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control. ""But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,"" he says. For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS. Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells. But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence. It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi. ""If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,"" he warns. ""That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters."" There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks. The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle. ""So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,"" she says. ""Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?"" Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life. ""If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?"" she asks. So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?",2025-02-26T00:59:59.869Z,Jiyar Gol
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0dv7rxxvo,The unseen map that promised to bring peace to the Middle East,"""In the next 50 years, you will not find one Israeli leader that will propose to you what I propose to you now. ""Sign it! Sign it and let's change history!"" It was 2008. Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was imploring the Palestinian leader to accept a deal he believed could have brought peace to the Middle East. It was a two-state solution - a prospect which seems impossible today. If implemented, it would have created a Palestinian state on more than 94% of the occupied West Bank. The map Olmert had drawn up now has an almost mythical status. Various interpretations have appeared over the years, but he has never revealed it to the media. Until now. In Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October, the latest series from documentary filmmaker Norma Percy available on iPlayer from Monday, Olmert reveals the map he says he showed to Mahmoud Abbas at a meeting in Jerusalem on 16 September 2008. ""This is the first time that I expose this map to the media,"" he tells the filmmakers. It shows, in detail, the territory which Olmert proposed to annexe to Israel - 4.9% of the West Bank. That would have included major Jewish settlement blocs - just like previous proposals dating back to the late 1990s. In return, the prime minister said Israel would give up an equal amount of Israeli territory, along the edges of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The two Palestinian territories would be connected via a tunnel or highway – again, something that had been discussed before. In the film, Olmert recalls the Palestinian leader's response. ""He said: 'Prime minister, this is very serious. It is very, very, very serious.'"" Crucially, Olmert's plan included a proposed solution to the thorny issue of Jerusalem. Each side would be able to claim parts of the city as their capital, while administration of the ""holy basin"" - including the Old City, with its religious sites, and adjacent areas - would be handed over to a committee of trustees consisting of Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the US. The implications of the map, for Jewish settlements, would have been colossal. Had the plan been implemented, dozens of communities, scattered throughout the West Bank and Jordan Valley, would have been evacuated. When the previous Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, forcibly removed a few thousand Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was regarded as a national trauma by those on the Israeli right. Evacuating most of the West Bank would have represented an infinitely greater challenge, involving tens of thousands of settlers, with the very real danger of violence. But the test never came. At the end of their meeting, Olmert refused to hand over a copy of the map to Mahmoud Abbas unless the Palestinian leader sign it. Abbas refused, saying that he needed to show his experts the map, to make sure they understood exactly what was being offered. Olmert says the two agreed to a meeting of map experts the following day. ""We parted, you know, like we are about to embark on a historic step forward,"" Olmert says. The meeting never happened. As they drove away from Jerusalem that night, President Abbas's chief of staff, Rafiq Husseini, remembers the atmosphere in the car. ""Of course, we laughed,"" he says in the film. The Palestinians believed the plan was dead in the water. Olmert, embroiled in an unrelated corruption scandal, had already announced that he was planning to resign. ""It is unfortunate that Olmert, regardless of how nice he was… was a lame duck,"" Husseini says, ""and therefore, we will go nowhere with this."" The situation in Gaza also complicated matters. After months of rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory, Olmert ordered a major Israeli assault, Operation Cast Lead, at the end of December, triggering three weeks of intense fighting. But Olmert tells me it would have been ""very smart"" for Abbas to sign the deal. Then, if a future Israeli prime minister tried to cancel it, ""he could have said to the world that the failure was Israel's fault"". Israeli elections followed in February. Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu, a vocal opponent of Palestinian statehood, became prime minister. Olmert's plan, and map, faded from view. The former prime minister says he's still waiting for Abbas's reply, but his plan has since joined a long list of missed opportunities to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 1973, the former Israeli diplomat, Abba Eban, quipped that the Palestinians ""never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity"". It's a phrase that Israeli officials have frequently repeated in the years since. But the world is more complicated than that, especially since the two sides signed the historic Oslo Accords in 1993. The peace process ushered in by a handshake on the White House lawn between former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had moments of genuine hope, punctuated by tragedy. Ultimately, it resulted in failure. The reasons are complex and there's plenty of blame to go around but in truth, the stars were never properly aligned. I witnessed this non-alignment at first hand 24 years ago. In January 2001, at the Egyptian resort of Taba, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators once again saw the outlines of a deal. A member of the Palestinian delegation drew a rough map on a napkin and told me that, for the first time, they were looking at the rough outlines of a viable Palestinian state. But the talks were irrelevant, drowned out by the violence raging on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza, where the second Palestinian uprising, or ""intifada"", had erupted the previous September. Once again, Israel was in the midst of a political transition. Prime Minister Ehud Barak had already resigned. Ariel Sharon comfortably defeated him a few weeks later. The map on the napkin, just like Olmert's map eight years later, showed what might have been.",2025-02-24T01:04:43.214Z,Paul Adams
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyjj3knjkmo,Injured Gazan boy takes first steps after surgery in Jordan,"Rami Qattoush's mother beams with pride, as her nine-year-old son tentatively kicks a football for the first time since his injury. It is a huge milestone in his recovery, since he travelled to Jordan last month after getting Israeli military approval to leave Gaza. Rami dreams of playing football one day, like Cristiano Ronaldo. But he is still in pain and quickly tires, having to sit down on a plastic chair, exhausted from the effort. His bandaged legs - one of them splinted - are badly scarred and withered. Every step forward is hard. Doctors in Gaza had urged the family to agree to have both of his legs amputated. But his eight-year-old brother, Abdul Salam, had already lost his lower right leg due to his injuries and their mother, Islam, begged the surgeons to save Rami's limbs. Warning - This article contains distressing content The boys had been fast asleep in the family's third-floor flat in Maghazi in central Gaza when, their mother says, an Israeli air strike targeted the building next door, raining rubble and shrapnel on the children. Rami's 12-year-old brother, Mustafa, was killed, his body blown to pieces. His heart, pierced with shrapnel, was only found two days later, Islam says. The family gave it a separate burial. The UN says at least 14,500 children are reported to have been killed and many more badly wounded in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people. Medical evacuations from Gaza are critical, it says, because the healthcare system there has been devastated. Only 20 of the territory's 35 hospitals are partially functional and there are shortages of essential medicines and equipment. An estimated 30,000 Gazans – like Rami and Abdul Salam – have been left with life-changing injuries which will require years of rehabilitation, according to the World Health Organization. It has helped facilitate the evacuation of hundreds of patients since 1 February when the Rafah crossing with Egypt reopened for them. But it says that between 12,000 and 14,000 people – among them 4,500 children – still need to be brought out for treatment. ""The war has exacted a horrific toll on Gaza's children,"" the UN Children's Fund (Unicef) said when a ceasefire deal was announced in January. Rami endured several surgical procedures without painkillers, anaesthesia or antibiotics, his mother told the BBC. His wounds became so infected that they were crawling with maggots. Doctors did not think his legs could be saved. ""Rami was in such pain, he was screaming 'God, you've taken my brother, now take me too!'"" Islam says. And then, in January, a rare chance came up - for Rami and his mother to be evacuated to Jordan for treatment at a specialised hospital for reconstructive surgery, run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Jordan's capital, Amman. It is currently treating 13 children from Gaza, but has the capacity to take in dozens more. ""It's the only hospital I know of providing physical and mental rehabilitation for victims of war,"" says Marc Schakal, MSF programme manager for Jordan, Syria and Yemen. ""It's multi-disciplinary care, not just surgery."" Rami has a psychologist, surgeon and physiotherapist. He is also being fed, clothed, and taught at MSF's small ""School of the Future"", a bright prefabricated building in the grounds of the hospital. After missing so much education, he is a keen learner. But he has also been missing his father Mohammed and his brother, Abdul Salam - who needs a prosthetic leg but wasn't able to leave Gaza with him. They're grateful for their treatment, but both he and his mother want to return home as soon as they can. ""Gaza is beautiful,"" Rami told me. ""In Gaza before the war, we used to have medical treatment, but then the aid stopped."" With the facilities and expertise at the MSF hospital, he's now making quick progress. ""He arrived in a wheelchair,"" says his physiotherapist, Zaid Alqaisi, who has formed a strong bond with Rami while helping him to walk again. ""He's very motivated. He wants to get back to his friends and his family. He wants to make his dad proud."" He also wants to swim again in the sea in Gaza. But many more operations lie ahead, and Rami and his mother have no idea when they will return home. Not knowing if they will be allowed back into Gaza is another huge stress for all of the Palestinian patients on top of their trauma, according to psychologist Zainoun al-Sunna. Sharing a hospital room with Rami is a withdrawn and traumatized five-year-old boy, Abdul Rahman al-Madhoun, who also needs surgery on his legs. He was in his mother's arms when she was killed in an air strike in October 2023, along with his siblings. In hospital in Gaza, a nurse trying to cheer him up told him his mother had turned into a star. ""Since then, he looks up into the sky at night, looking for stars and talking to them,"" his aunt Sabah says. ""He doesn't talk to other people. But I hear him saying to the stars: 'Mummy I've eaten, Mummy I'm going to sleep now.'"" The psychological injuries of the hospital patients are often tougher than the physical. ""Some will never recover,"" says hospital director Roshan Kumarasamy, who says that reconstructive surgery will be needed on patients from Gaza for years to come because of an ""unimaginably massive spectrum of injuries"". But Rami is strong and determined. When he breaks down in tears thinking of Mustafa, he reassures me it's ""OK"". And when he and his mother manage to get through to his family in Gaza on a video call, Rami is eager to show them how he can now stand on his own two feet.

And now his family have another reason to celebrate – Rami's brother, Abdul Salam, and his father have just been given permission by Israel to leave Gaza for Jordan as well.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy05jeq2rv2o,Police to interview Crown actor over Gaza rally,"Actor Khalid Abdalla says he has been told to attend a police interview following a pro-Palestinian protest in January. Abdalla, who played Dodi Fayed in Netflix series The Crown, said on social media he had received a letter from the Metropolitan Police on Thursday. The Metropolitan Police confirmed to the BBC that eight people had been ""invited to be interviewed under caution at a police station"" as part of an ""ongoing investigation into alleged breaches of Public Order Act conditions on Saturday 18 January"". In an Instagram post, Abdalla said it remained to be seen if charges would result, adding that ""the right to protest is under attack in this country"". Abdalla, who also starred in United 93, The Kite Runner and The Day of the Jackal, is one of Hollywood's most outspoken actors on the Gaza-Israel war. He has publicly called for a permanent ceasefire. The actor has attended several pro-Palestinian demos, including the one on 18 January he will be interviewed by the police about. And he was a signatory to the Artists for Palestine UK open letter to the BBC in February, criticising the corporation's decision to pull a documentary about children's lives in Gaza after it discovered its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official. Abdalla is not the first public figure to face a police interview following the January rally. The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have already been questioned by officers. The Met has not identified the pair but said at the time that two men, aged 75 and 73, had subsequently been ""released pending further investigations"". A static rally involving several thousand people took place in Whitehall after police blocked plans to hold a march from Portland Place, near the headquarters of the BBC. Police said conditions had been clearly communicated that those taking part in the protest should remain in Whitehall. ""Despite this, a large group made its way from Whitehall into Trafalgar Square and in some cases attempted to go further."" Police said that a number of people in that group have been arrested on suspicion of breaching the conditions - and that so far, 21 had been charged.  The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, which organised the protest, said: ""What is claimed by the police as justification for this massive overreach of their powers is a complete misrepresentation of what took place, not just on the day but beforehand."" And it added: ""We demand that the Metropolitan Police halt any prosecutions or proceedings against those involved in this entirely peaceful protest.""",2025-03-04T00:01:37.182Z,Charlotte Gallagher
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74kzjvypgeo,Gaza ceasefire deal hits critical moment as first phase ends,"Where next? The first six-week phase of the Gaza ceasefire ends on Saturday. The 42 days since 19 January have seen their fair share of uncertainty, hope, grief and anger, but everything that should have happened in that time has. Israeli hostages - the living and the dead - have been released. Palestinian prisoners set free. But negotiations on phase two, including the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, have barely begun. Talks opened in Cairo on Friday but Israel's delegation returned home in the evening. Reports suggested that negotiations would continue ""at a distance"" and that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to hold late-night consultations with the delegation, senior ministers and intelligence chiefs. For such a meeting to take place late on the sabbath was highly unusual. No statements emerged from the consultations, with reports suggesting they would continue on Saturday night. Israel appears to be looking to extend the current phase for another six weeks, to get more hostages back and release more Palestinian prisoners but without withdrawing its troops. The government here is adamant that Hamas, the group responsible for the massacres of 7 October 2023 and the taking of 251 hostages, has to lay down its arms and relinquish any form of authority in the Gaza Strip. Israel also says it is not yet ready to leave the Philadelphi corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border - a process that should have begun on Saturday. ""We will not allow the Hamas murderers to again roam our borders with pickup trucks and guns, and we will not allow them to rearm through smuggling,"" an unnamed Israeli official said in a statement sent to reporters on Friday. Such anonymous quotes are often believed to come directly from the prime minister's office. Last summer, efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza faltered when Netanyahu insisted on keeping Israeli troops stationed along the Philadelphi corridor. On Friday night, Hamas said it would not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that phase two would eventually take place. Hamas seems determined to remain a force in Gaza, even if it might be willing to hand over day-to-day governance to other Palestinian actors, including the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. Egypt has been working on a reconstruction plan for Gaza, as an alternative to Donald Trump's proposal to take the area over and evacuate its entire civilian population. But Western diplomats are not optimistic that the plan, due to be unveiled at an Arab League summit in Cairo next Tuesday, has the sort of robust security and governance arrangements that will be needed to meet Israeli demands. This is a critical moment. For all the emotional turmoil of the last few weeks, Israelis have come to expect the gradual release of hostages. There are believed to be 24 alive, still waiting to be freed, with another 39 presumed to be dead. Israelis desperately want them all back, without the sort of propaganda displays that have disgusted and infuriated the entire country. If the whole process now grinds to a halt, public anger – at Hamas and their own government - will mount. Further street protests are planned, including one on Saturday night in the place in Tel Aviv that all Israelis now know as Hostages Square. ""We demand the return of all 59 remaining hostages by day 50 of the agreement,"" reads the invitation from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum HQ. ""Now is our only window of opportunity – we won't get another."" UN Secretary General António Guterres has weighed in, urging the parties ""to spare no effort to avoid a breakdown of this deal"". On Saturday evening, Israelis were once again horrified by the sight of hostages being paraded in front of the cameras, in a video released by Hamas. In the latest in a long line of cruel, harrowing videos released over the past 16 months, five Israeli hostages are seen, two of them with their faces blurred. Two of the hostages, Iair Horn and Sagui Dekel Chen, were released two weeks ago. In the video, Iair is seen embracing and saying goodbye to his younger brother, Eitan, suggesting the scene was filmed shortly before Iair and Sagui were released. The emotions are raw and the scene deeply distressing, with both brothers in tears and Eitan pleading to Benjamin Netanyahu to stick with the ceasefire deal and release all remaining hostages. The video is clearly designed, once again, to play on the frayed emotions of the Israeli public and heap pressure on the Israeli prime minister. In a statement released by his office, Netanyahu accused Hamas of producing ""another cruel propaganda video in which our hostages are forced to engage in psychological warfare."" Israel, the statement said, would not be deterred by Hamas propaganda. ""We will continue to act relentlessly for the return of all of our hostages and until all objectives of the war are met."" There's a widespread belief that, sooner or later, the war will begin again. It's a bleak prospect, for the hostages and for two million Palestinians in Gaza who are trying to put their lives back together in the current, fragile peace. In a place where families are still digging bodies from the rubble, sometimes with their bare hands, the thought of a resumption of a conflict which has already claimed tens of thousands of lives is chilling. Areas in the middle of the Gaza Strip that have so far escaped the worst of the conflict would likely suffer badly from any return to war, making it even harder to sustain life in this ravaged strip of land.",2025-03-01T18:54:18.350Z,Paul Adams
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvee8vr7l1o,"Israel's military failed to protect civilians, first report on 7 October attack says","Israel's military has published its first official account of the mistakes that led to its failures during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, which triggered the Gaza war. The report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ""failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians"". The 19-page report contains much that is already known about what led to catastrophic loss of about 1,200 lives when approximately 5,000 gunmen from Hamas and other Palestinian groups stormed into Israel, also taking 251 hostages in the process. There are no dramatic revelations, but it is still sobering to see the military's conclusions about how it misjudged Hamas's intentions and underestimated its capabilities laid out in black and white. The report says the military regarded Gaza as a secondary security threat, with priority given to Iran and Hezbollah. Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was ""paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative"". The military had chosen a ""conflict management"" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was ""neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war"" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics. Evidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as ""unrealistic or unfeasible"", reflecting ""Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat"". The report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas's plan was not merely a vision but ""a concrete framework for operational planning"". However, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence. The report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed. ""There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?"" the report says. Over time, ""a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality"" had developed. The report also highlights what it says was ""a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history"". It calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, ""fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement"". It says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October. The Gaza Division, it says, ""was effectively defeated for several hours"" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively. It says the Air Force responded quickly, but that ""there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists"". The report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians. After presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures. ""I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me,"" he said in a video. Last month, the general announced his resignation over the failures and called for a commission of inquiry to carry out a broader investigation that would help prevent another attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not acknowledged any responsibility for what happened on 7 October, has said such a state inquiry should wait until the end of the war. His critics accuse Mr Netanyahu of being unwilling to admit any personal fault. Israel responded to the 7 October attack by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2025-02-27T20:19:25.512Z,Paul Adams
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdx1rpel6o,Israel confirms Hamas handed over hostages' bodies as Palestinian prisoners released,"Israel has completed forensic tests confirming the identities of four dead Israeli hostages whose bodies were handed over by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Wednesday night, Hamas passed four coffins to the Red Cross from Gaza. Israel's prime minister confirmed on Thursday that they contained the remains of Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69, and said all four men had been murdered. The handover cleared the way for the delayed release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. It was the last exchange of the six-week-long first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, leaving questions over what happens next. Hamas has said it is ready to start delayed indirect negotiations on the second phase, which aims to end the war and secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who faces pressures from his political allies to resume fighting and crush Hamas - said he had instructed negotiators to depart for Cairo on Thursday for talks. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in response to its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,365 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter. Hamas handed over the four men's bodies late on Wednesday night, with no public ceremony, unlike in previous exchanges during the current ceasefire. Israeli authorities carried out initial forensic testing close to the Israel-Gaza border before transferring the remains to the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. It came after the body of a Palestinian woman from Gaza was handed over by Hamas to Israel instead of the body of hostage Shiri Bibas last week, prompting fury in Israel. Hamas said it was a mistake and transferred Bibas's body the following day. Following the identification of the bodies received overnight, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that military officials had informed the Mansour, Yahalomi, Idan and Elgarat families that their loved ones ""were murdered and have been returned for burial in Israel"". ""Pursuant to the intelligence and all of the information at our disposal, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat were murdered while held hostage in Gaza,"" it added. ""Shlomo Mansour was murdered in the 7 October 2023 massacre and his body had been held in the Gaza Strip."" There was no immediate response to the allegations from Hamas. Tsachi Idan was taken by Hamas gunmen from his home in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023. His eldest child, Maayan - who had just turned 18 - was shot and killed in front of her siblings and parents. His family said that ""the unbearable journey to bring back our beloved and dear Tsachi from the inferno in Gaza has ended with the identification of his body"". Itzik Elgarat was kidnapped from Nir Oz, another kibbutz, and reportedly shot in the hand during the attack. Ohad Yahalomi, a French-Israeli dual national, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. Iraq-born Shlomo Mansour was killed by Hamas at Kibbutz Kissufim on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage. His sister, Hadassah Lazar, told Israel's Channel 12 that ""we've reached an absurd situation where we take comfort in receiving a body to bury"". But, she added: ""The circle is not yet closed. We will continue fighting until the last hostage returns home."" President Isaac Herzog said: ""Together with the entire nation, we share in the immense grief and sorrow of the bereaved families and [their] communities. ""The return of our brothers' bodies from captivity underscores our moral obligation to do everything in our power to bring back all the hostages - the living to their loving families, and the fallen to be late to rest."" The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the hostages' families, insisted that Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat could have returned alive if the Israeli government had agreed to the ceasefire deal sooner. ""[They] endured a prolonged period in Hamas captivity in Gaza. They should have returned alive; they could have been saved and brought back through an agreement."" It urged Israel's leaders to ensure the return of the 59 hostages remaining in captivity - 35 of whom are presumed dead - by the start of next week, warning that they ""have no time left"". Netanyahu promised Israeli authorities would ""act relentlessly until we bring everyone back"". Following the handover of the hostages' bodies, buses carrying Palestinian prisoners were seen leaving Ofer prison in the north of the occupied West Bank and then arriving in Ramallah, where a large crowd gathered to celebrate their release. ""We have been taken out of suffering as if we have been dug out from our own graves. No prisoner has had the experience of having their own release delayed twice,"" one of the prisoners, Yahya Shrida, told reporters. ""What we have been through is a situation that the mountains can't carry. It is very hard to explain."" Later, dozens more Palestinians were seen getting off buses outside the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. Many of them said they had endured harsh conditions while in detention. ""During the first period in jail, we were handcuffed and blindfolded for 90 days, you see no-one and no-one sees us. And we used to sit on our knees or on our buttocks for 18 or 20 hours,"" Eyad al-Saudi said. He added: ""We left behind young detainees, and our joy will not be complete until the remaining detained prisoners are released from prison."" The Israeli military and prison service have previously said that detainees and prisoners are treated in accordance with the law. The Palestinian Prisoners Media Office said a total of 642 Palestinians in Israeli jails were supposed to be released in the exchange. Among them were 445 Gazans who were detained by Israeli forces without charge during the war and 46 women and children, it said. The 151 prisoners include dozens convicted of carrying out deadly attacks on Israelis who are being sent abroad. Israel had delayed the releases since last Saturday in protest at what it said were ""Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"". Hamas said Israel's decision was a ""blatant"" violation and said indirect talks about further steps in the ceasefire deal were conditional on the prisoners being released. After days of impasse, Egyptian mediators secured the new exchange, with the Israeli prime minister's office saying the hostages' bodies would be handed over ""in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies"". A Hamas official meanwhile said the handover would take place ""without public presence to prevent the occupation from finding any pretext for delay or obstruction"". It remains unclear whether the truce will be extended or progress to a planned second phase, which would see the release of all remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners. Indirect negotiations for the second phase were due to start earlier this month but they have not yet got under way. Hamas affirmed the group's ""full commitment to the ceasefire agreement"" on Thursday and its ""readiness to enter into negotiations for the second phase"". Later, the Israeli prime minister's office said he had ""instructed the negotiation delegation to depart for Cairo today to continue the talks"", without giving any details. ""Our delegation will go to Cairo and see whether we have a common ground to negotiate,"" Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters. ""We said we are ready to make the framework longer in return to release more hostages. If it is possible we'll do that.""",2025-02-27T12:39:05.198Z,David Gritten & George Wright
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62k676gk34o,"Six babies have died from cold in Gaza over two weeks, medics say","At least six babies have died in the past two weeks in Gaza due to the cold weather and lack of adequate shelter and heating, Palestinian medics and health officials say. Doctors at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City, in the north, said nine newborn babies suffering from cold injuries had been admitted, five of whom had died, with one other in a critical condition. The family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight. The PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters. The Palestinian armed group Hamas has accused Israel of failing to allow in agreed amounts of tents, caravans and other shelter supplies during a ceasefire that began five weeks ago. Israel has denied this. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times during the 16-month war between Israel and Hamas and almost 70% of buildings in the territory are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare system has also collapsed, with only 18 of the 35 hospitals partially functional and shortages of essential medical equipment. According to meteorological websites, the night-time temperature in Gaza has regularly fallen below 10C (50F) over the past two weeks. It dropped to 3C (37F) on Monday night, after the PFBS hospital's medical director Dr Saeed Salah had warned in a video that three babies suffering from cold injuries, including hypothermia, had died over the same period. He said the babies were only one or two days old, and had weighed between 1.7kg and 2kg (3.7-4.4lbs). On Tuesday, Dr Salah and a paediatrician at the hospital, Dr Samer Lubad, reported that another two newborns had died. ""The last several weeks we [had] nine neonates in our hospital. And they came with case that they call 'cold injury' or hypothermia,"" Dr Lubad told Al Jazeera TV. ""Three babies survived and were treated successfully and discharged home. There is still one baby in our neonatal ICU in a critical general condition."" He added: ""Of course, this condition is because of the cold weather and lack of safe shelters, lack of central heating, and lack of electricity in the Gaza Strip."" Meanwhile, the head of the paediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis told the Associated Press that it had received the body of a two-month-old girl who had died of hypothermia on Tuesday. A video posted by a local journalist appeared to show the girl being buried by her father and uncle, who said she was named Sham Yousef al-Shambari. He said she had been healthy and that her mother had found her ""stiff as wood from the cold"" when she tried to wake her for feeding during the night inside the family's tent in the al-Mawasi area. Dr Muneer al-Boursh, director general of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said in a statement a total of 15 children had died due to the cold since the start of the winter. He also alleged that Israel had ""failed to comply with humanitarian protocols, including allowing the entry of medical equipment, heating supplies, tents, and mobile homes"" since the ceasefire began on 19 January. Hamas has previously said that Israel was required to allow in about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans during the six-week-long first phase of the deal. Israeli military body Cogat said Israel was ""committed to and complies with the obligation to allow the entry of 4,200 humanitarian aid trucks per week"" into Gaza, including those carrying tents and shelter supplies. ""Based on the data available to us, hundreds of thousands of tents have entered the Gaza Strip since the agreement came into effect,"" it added. It comes amid continued uncertainty over whether the ceasefire will continue past Saturday, when the deal's first phase is set to expire. On Sunday, Israel postponed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for 10 hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, accusing the group of cynically using its hostages for propaganda purposes. Hamas accused Israel of a ""blatant"" violation of the deal and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv4m4npnedo,Syrian leader hails 'historic' dialogue conference,"Syria's interim president has told a national dialogue conference that the country has a ""historic"" opportunity to rebuild after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad. Ahmed al-Sharaa also stressed the need for armed groups to integrate into the military and for the state to have a monopoly on weapons, saying Syria's ""strength lies in its unity"". The 600 delegates have been asked to provide recommendations on transitional justice, the economy, the new constitution and other topics to guide a new transitional government. But there has been criticism that the process has been rushed, and the Kurdish-led militia alliance and autonomous administration which control north-eastern Syria were not invited. The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist, with Bashar becoming president in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez. In 2011, Bashar brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes. On 8 December, he fled to Russia after a rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept down from north-western Syria and entered Damascus in the space of only 12 days. Seven weeks later, Sharaa was named president for the ""transitional period"" by his fellow rebel commanders. They also announced the cancellation of the 2012 constitution, the dissolution of the parliament, army and security agencies, and the integration of all rebel groups into the new state institutions replacing them. Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to discuss Syria's future, which he said would be followed by a ""constitutional declaration"" to serve during the transition. ""Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it to build itself on its own,"" Sharaa said in a speech at the national dialogue conference in Damascus on Tuesday. ""What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country."" The organising committee said six working groups would be formed to discuss a transitional justice system, the new constitution, reforming and building state institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society, and the country's future economic model. The groups would agree non-binding recommendations, which would be presented to the new transitional government set to take power on Saturday and help shape the constitutional declaration, according to the committee. Sharaa said a transitional justice body would soon be formed to ""restore people's rights"" and start holding to account those who committed crimes against Syrians during the civil war. He also reiterated that non-state armed groups had to disarm and hand over their territory. ""The unity of arms and their monopoly by the state is not a luxury but a duty and an obligation,"" he said. ""Syria is indivisible; it is a complete whole, and its strength lies in its unity."" The interim government's forces control Syria's biggest cities, but large parts of the country are still held by various armed groups. They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance supported by the US, which controls most of the north-east and serves as the armed forces of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES). The SDF has so far refused to integrate its forces into the new Syrian army, although negotiations have been taking place in recent weeks. Organisers of the conference said the SDF and AANES had not been invited because of that refusal, and that Kurds would be represented in Damascus even if they were not. However, SDF spokesman Farhad Shami told AFP news agency that ""the exclusion of the SDF and large sections of Syrian society confirm that the conference serves to please the outside world and not to seek a better future"". Thirty-five parties in the AANES also criticised what they claimed was the ""token representation"" of Kurds and other minorities, saying such events were ""meaningless, worthless, and will not contribute to finding real solutions to the country's ongoing crisis"". Moutasem Sioufi of The Day After, an independent civil society group that is participating in the conference, told the BBC that it was important that all groups were involved. ""We need to have dialogue with all the Syrian groups, with all Syrian powers, especially those who have great influence on the ground. Without that Syria would face a very hard time maintaining itself together,"" he said. The outcomes of the conference will be closely watched by the international community, which has called for an inclusive political process that represents the country's many ethnic and religious communities. During the civil war, the US, the UK, and the European Union imposed a wide range of sanctions on Syria targeting Assad's government and its allies in response to atrocities committed during the civil war. They have lifted some of the sanctions that crippled the Syrian economy since Assad's fall, but made further steps dependent on Syria's new leaders keeping promises to respect minority rights and move towards democracy. On Monday, the EU announced that it was suspending sanctions on its energy, transport and banking sectors to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani welcomed that decision, but he criticised the international sanctions still in place in a speech to the national dialogue conference. ""These sanctions are illegitimate and are not based on any legal or moral foundations,"" he said. ""They are being used as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people."" HTS, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, is subject to separate sanctions because it continues to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK.",2025-02-25T15:00:58.229Z,David Gritten
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgenz02lp8o,Israel demands complete demilitarisation of southern Syria,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the complete demilitarisation of much of southern Syria. It is an announcement that could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria, after the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad, more likely. In a speech to Israeli military cadets on Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel would not allow the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Assad - nor the new Syrian army that is being formed to ""enter the area south of Damascus"". ""We demand the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Deraa and Suweida from the forces of the new regime,"" he added. ""Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria."" He also said that Israeli forces would remain indefinitely inside the Syrian territory that they have seized since Assad's fall last December - which would be a shift in Israeli strategy. Until now, Israel had described its move into a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan Heights as a temporary measure to ensure the security of Israelis on the other side. The rationale appeared to be to prevent extremist groups from moving down to the Golan in the power vacuum. But with his latest comments, Netanyahu has made it clear that he believes that the new authorities in Syria - with their background in jihadism - could represent a similar danger. Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so in 2019. Syria's new interim President, HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, has tried to reassure Israel that he does not want conflict and that he is ready to uphold the long-standing disengagement agreement between the two countries concluded after another war in 1973. He has also stressed that he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks against Israel. But Sharaa has also called on Israel to withdraw from the buffer zone it has taken, as he tries to assert sovereignty across the whole of Syria's fractured landscape. Clearly, Netanyahu does not trust these assurances. Like much of the international community, the Israeli prime minister is waiting to see if Sharaa makes good on his moderate, emollient stance in action as well as words. From the perspective of the new Syrian leadership, freeing the country from the influence of all the foreign powers that jockeyed for position during the long years of civil war is seen as vital to ensuring a more positive future for the country and a definitive break with the past. Some foreign players, such as Iran and Russia, have seen for now at least the curtailment of the overweening influence they once had. Under President Donald Trump, the US might also further disengage from Syria - a role which has helped underpin Kurdish-led forces in the north-east of the country. There has, though, been growing influence from Turkey - which provided essential support for HTS in its lightning campaign against Assad. How big a part it chooses to play could be a determining factor in how Syria develops in the post-Assad era. But Israel may present a more immediate challenge to the independence of Syria's new leadership. To have Israeli troops increasingly infringing on the country's territory - as well as carrying out numerous strikes on targets associated with what's left of Assad's military arsenal - does not fit with the vision of a re-unified, sovereign state that Sharaa is trying to convince Syrians both inside and outside the country that his leadership can provide. Netanyahu's move to forbid Syrian forces from operating freely within the country's borders may be a step too far for the new order in Damascus to stomach, however non-confrontational an image it is trying to maintain.",2025-02-24T21:31:48.351Z,Sebastian Usher
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw7rrlvmjo,Hamas says no Gaza ceasefire talks unless Israel releases prisoners,"Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed. Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including ""humiliating"" handover ceremonies. A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to ""grave danger"" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel. The deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the ceasefire was ""precarious"" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. He also called for the ""dignified release of all remaining hostages"". On Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages. As with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel. Later, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a ""sickening display of cruelty"". There was already fury in Israel after Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel. It emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day. Israeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys ""with their bare hands"", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike. Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails. They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers. In the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed ""in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"". ""It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies."" Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a ""blatant violation"" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released. ""We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,"" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday. Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that ""all options are on the table"". ""Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],"" he added. ""Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?"" Naim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released. The White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an ""appropriate response"" to what it called the ""barbaric treatment"" of hostages by Hamas. But President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting ""an extension of phase one"". ""We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,"" he told CNN on Sunday. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase. So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal. The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day. The ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",2025-02-24T16:12:21.962Z,David Gritten
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw20d3l4jpo,Israel confirms Shiri Bibas body has been returned,"Israel's forensic officials have confirmed a body handed over by Hamas on Friday is that of hostage Shiri Bibas - but have rejected Hamas's claim that she was killed by Israeli bombing. Dr Chen Kugel, director of Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said an examination found ""no evidence of injuries caused by bombing"". On Friday, Israel said that the two children of Shiri Bibas - Ariel and Kfir - had been killed with ""bare hands"" and that evidence of this had been sent to Israel's partners around the world. The BBC has not seen or verified this evidence. Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence. ""Our Shiri was murdered in captivity and has now returned home,"" the Bibas family said in a statement. The remains of Ariel, Kfir and another hostage, Oded Lifschitz, were handed over by Hamas on Thursday - alongside a fourth body which it said was that of Shiri Bibas. Israel's forensic testing then showed that these remains were in fact of a different unidentified woman. Hamas spokesman Ismail al-Thawabta said in a post on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after the air strike. Hamas released the correct remains on Friday evening. The Bibas family said: ""For 16 months, we sought certainty, and now that we have it, there is no comfort in it, but we hope for the beginning of a closure."" Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told a press conference ""forensic findings"", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested Ariel and Kfir had been killed ""deliberately"". He said evidence had been shared with ""partners around the world so they can verify it"". Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months respectively when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. They were taken hostage along with the children's father, Yarden Bibas, 34, who was released alive by Hamas on 1 February. Under the first phase of a ceasefire deal, which began on 19 January and lasts for 42 days, Hamas agreed to hand over 33 hostages in return for Israel freeing 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. On Saturday, the armed group released Eliya Cohen, 27, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shohan, 40, and 23-year-old Omer Wenkert - all of whom were taken during the 7 October attacks. Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengitsu, who was captured by Hamas in 2014, was also released. Hisham al-Sayed, a Bedouin Arab-Israeli held in Gaza since 2015, was handed over separately. Israel is due to free 602 Palestinian prisoners. In subsequent stages of the agreement, Hamas will release the remaining living hostages from Gaza and return the bodies of dead hostages. Israel has pledged to release more Palestinian prisoners. In the 7 October attacks, about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. In response, Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry.",2025-02-22T20:27:40.863Z,Jaroslav Lukiv

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said ""forensic findings"", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested the boys had been killed with ""bare hands"". He said evidence had been shared with Israel's ""partners around the world so they can verify it"". Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence. The bodies of the two boys were returned to Israel on Thursday, alongside the body of another hostage, Oded Lifschitz. Hamas said a fourth body handed over was that of the boys' mother, Shiri Bibas - but Israel said forensic testing showed it was not her. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged Hamas ""put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin"" instead of the body of Shiri Bibas. The IDF posted on X that ""during the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage. This is an anonymous, unidentified body."" ""This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organisation, which is obligated under the agreement to return four deceased hostages.""  A Hamas spokesman, Ismail al-Thawabta, said on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under the rubble of a structure after an Israeli air strike. The group told Reuters news agency they would investigate what had led to the wrong remains being sent to Israel. Israel demanded that Hamas return Shiri along with the other remaining hostages. ""Whether she is alive or not, they need to bring back Shiri Bibas,"" IDF international spokesperson Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. Netanyahu said ""we will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages - both living and dead - and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement"". In a statement, Hamas said it affirmed its ""seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations"" and had no interest in ""non-compliance"". Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. They have become a symbol for many in Israel and the news that their bodies would be returned to Israel was met with an outpouring of grief. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said it was ""horrified and devastated"" that Shiri had not been returned, ""despite the agreement and our desperate hopes"". The children's father Yarden Bibas, 34, was released by Hamas on 1 February. Israel has confirmed that the fourth body returned on Thursday was that of veteran peace activist, Oded Lifschitz. The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January, and Israel has confirmed it expects eight bodies will be handed over. The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire. Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month, but have not yet begun. Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged. Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken more than a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Also on Thursday, three buses exploded in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv, in what Israeli police said is a suspected terror attack. Devices in two other buses failed to explode, they said. No casualties were reported. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced he had ordered the IDF to carry out an ""intensive operation against centers of terrorism"" in the West Bank.",2025-02-21T19:33:35.093Z,George Wright & Mallory Moench
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8mv5dp0r3o,'The smallest coffins are the heaviest': Israel grieves youngest hostages,"Kfir and Ariel Bibas were last seen on 7 October with their mother Shiri's hands around them, holding onto her boys surrounded by gunmen and violence, trying to protect them. She couldn't. According to the Israeli army, Kfir and Ariel's last moments were at the ""bare hands"" of their captors. How do you eulogise children who have barely lived their lives? Kfir Bibas, a hostage at just nine months old, did not live to take his first steps or celebrate his first birthday. Ariel Bibas had only experienced four years of a life that should have been much longer. A statement from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the boys were taken hostage from, described Kfir as ""a calm and smiley baby, with ginger hair and a laugh that would make anyone's heart melt. Wherever he went he lit it up with his smile and joy."" Ariel, they said, was ""a playful boy with ginger hair, curious eyes and a big smile. He loved superheroes, tractors and cars, and ran non-stop, climbing and exploring the world."" The two brothers became the greatest symbol of the hostage nightmare Israelis are enduring. Bringing home the Bibas family was a country's fervent hope. Throughout the last 16 months they have been remembered, prayed for, kept in the hearts of people, not just in Israel but by Jews and others across the world. Images were shared of the boys in their Batman costumes with Ariel's cape flying in the wind; of older brother Ariel hugging his baby brother Kfir when he was born; of Kfir giggling and gurgling as his father Yarden played with him. And then the image seared into the minds since Hamas's attack on 7 October: the boys clutching onto their mother Shiri Bibas, her face tormented in fear, as they were surrounded by gunmen and taken to Gaza. No one in Israel wanted this ending; where Kfir and Ariel returned, not to their innocent childhood, but with their tender years already over. And where their mother who protected them until the last moment has not even returned with them. In Israel, there is communal pain and grief. In a video statement, the Israeli Prime Minister said Ariel and Kfir Bibas and 84-year-old Oded Lifschitz, whose body was also returned on Thursday, were ""brutally murdered by Hamas savages."" Holding up a picture of the boys, Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Today is a tragic day. It's a day of boundless sorrow, of indescribable pain. ""Their bodies return home to a nation in mourning. A nation that will never forget and never forgive the evil that cut down these beautiful souls…The Bibas children in particular became the symbol of who we are, and who we're fighting against."" Netanyahu said: ""Who kidnaps a little boy and a baby and murders them? Monsters. That's who."" Israel's President Isaac Herzog said in a statement: ""Agony. Pain. Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters."" He asked for forgiveness on behalf of the country for not protecting them and bringing them home. Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the 7 October attacks. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attacks and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. This week, in Israel and abroad, people across social media posted images of broken orange hearts to represent the boys with the striking ginger hair. On Thursday, as the vehicles with the bodies of the Bibas children and Oded Lifschitz crossed into Israel, people lining the streets with Israeli flags shouted out ""sorry"". In October 2023 just weeks after they were kidnapped, the aunt of the Bibas brothers spoke to the BBC. Ofri Bibas Levy described how Kfir had just started crawling and eating solid food. ""They are civilians and are not supposed to be there. The longer they are there the harder it's going to be to recover them and the less chance they're going to come out alive,"" she said. On Friday she wrote on Facebook: ""I'm sorry Luli [Ariel], I'm sorry Firfir [Kfir]. ""You did not deserve any of this. We will miss you forever. We are not giving up on your mum Shiri."" In a video statement she added: ""Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were taken alive by a murderous terrorist organization, and it was Israel's responsibility and obligation to bring them back alive. ""There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7 and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we did not receive an apology from you in this painful moment. For Ariel and Kfir's sake, and for Yarden's sake, we are not seeking revenge right now. We are asking for Shiri."" Yarden Bibas, who was only recently released as a hostage, must now bury his two young boys, with his wife Shiri still not returned by Hamas. In Israel they are quoting words that painfully resonate: ""The smallest coffins are the heaviest.""",2025-02-21T19:30:11.687Z,Lucy Manning
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydwlxykzyo,Israel's 'hearts lie in tatters' as Hamas hands over first dead hostages,"""The hearts of an entire nation lie in tatters,"" Israel's President Isaac Herzog has said, as the bodies of four hostages taken alive by Hamas in its attack on 7 October 2023 were returned to Tel Aviv. Hamas says the bodies are those of a mother and two children from the Bibas family, whose unknown fate has gripped Israel. Israel has confirmed only the identity of the fourth - Oded Lifschitz, 84, a veteran peace activist - after a forensic examination. President Herzog wrote ""there are no words"" in a post on social media platform X, asking the four for forgiveness ""for not bringing you home safely"". It is the first time Hamas has returned captives dead since the ceasefire began last month. Following Hamas's handover of the four bodies, thousands of Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and observed a minute's silence. Six living hostages are due to be freed on Saturday. The news that Shiri Bibas, 33, and her sons, who would now be aged five and two, were dead triggered an outpouring of grief across the country. Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. The Israeli government never confirmed the claim. Addressing Israelis in a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was ""united in unbearable grief. Every home in Israel bows its head today. ""We all rage over the monsters of Hamas,"" he said. A lawyer for Dr Sharone Lifschitz, the British-based daughter of Oded Lifschitz, said the day was ""one of immense sadness, and of failure"". Early on Thursday morning, in choreographed scenes reminiscent of recent handovers of living hostages, four black coffins were laid out on a stage decked with propaganda in Khan Younis in southern Gaza in front of crowds of spectators. One of the backdrops depicted a ghoulish image of Benjamin Netanyahu with fangs looming over a picture of the four hostages when they were alive. Another read: ""The Return of the War = The Return of your Prisoners in Coffins"". One of those present, Ikram Abu Salout, told the BBC she was against handing over the bodies. ""They didn't remove the rubble and we don't even know where our children and families are."" A Red Cross official appeared to sign documents at a table alongside armed Hamas fighters before the four coffins transferred to vehicles belonging to the humanitarian organisation. United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said the handover was ""abhorrent and cruel, and flies in the face of international law"". ""We urge that all returns are conducted in privacy, and with respect and care,"" he added. The International Committee of the Red Cross echoed his words, saying: ""These operations should be done privately out of the utmost respect for the deceased and for those left grieving."" After the handover, the bodies were transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza and brought to Israel. People - many with Israeli flags and yellow ones representing the hostages - lined the streets as a police convoy with the coffins passed by. The bodies have been taken to the Abu Kabir forensic institute in Jaffa, Israel, for post-mortems. The Bibas family, and Oded Lifschtiz and his wife, were among residents taken from kibbutz Nir Oz when hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border with Israel and attacked communities, security forces sites and a music festival. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attack and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Yarden Bibas, 35, was released on 1 February along with two other hostages as part of an exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Oded Lifschitz, a retired journalist, had been held by the armed Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. His wife Yocheved was freed by Hamas on 23 October 2023. The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January. Israel has confirmed there will be eight. The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire. Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun.

The broadcaster has been criticised for Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which centred on a 13-year-old boy who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, Israel and others. The BBC said it had not been informed of the family connection in advance by the film's production company and has apologised ""for the omission of that detail"". The broadcaster has added a message to the start of the programme on its iPlayer streaming service, making clear the family link, and saying the production team had ""full editorial control"". Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she would discuss the matter with the BBC's director general and chairman, ""particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme"". A number of prominent TV figures including actress Tracy-Ann Oberman, Strike producer Neil Blair, former BBC One controller Danny Cohen and producer Leo Pearlman have written to the BBC to call for an investigation. They said: ""Given the serious nature of these concerns, the BBC should immediately postpone any broadcast repeats of the programme, remove it from iPlayer and take down any social media clips of the programme until an independent investigation is carried out and its findings published with full transparency for licence-fee payers."" They raised concerns about the ""editorial standards of this programme and the BBC's compliance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, its own Editorial Guidelines and English law"", and asked the corporation to explain what had happened. ""If the BBC was aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri was the son of a terrorist leader, why was this not disclosed to audiences during the programme?"" they asked. ""If the BBC was not aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri is the son of a terrorist leader, what diligence checks were undertaken and why did they fail?"" The BBC has kept the programme on iPlayer and the new message at the start reads: ""The narrator of this film is 13 year old Abdullah. His father has worked as a deputy agriculture minister for the Hamas-run government in Gaza. ""The production team had full editorial control of filming with Abdullah."" In a statement, the BBC said: ""Since the transmission of our documentary on Gaza, the BBC has become aware of the family connections of the film's narrator, a child called Abdullah. ""We've promised our audiences the highest standards of transparency, so it is only right that as a result of this new information, we add some more detail to the film before its retransmission. We apologise for the omission of that detail from the original film."" It added: ""We followed all of our usual compliance procedures in the making of this film, but we had not been informed of this information by the independent producers when we complied and then broadcast the finished film. ""The film remains a powerful child's eye view of the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza which we believe is an invaluable testament to their experiences, and we must meet our commitment to transparency."" Nandy said the matter was ""a conversation I'll definitely be having with the BBC"". Speaking to LBC on Thursday, she said: ""I watched it last night. It's something that I will be discussing with them, particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme. ""These things are difficult, and I do want to acknowledge that for the BBC, they take more care than most broadcasters in terms of the way that they try to portray these things. They've been attacked for being too pro-Gaza, they've been attacked for being anti-Gaza. But it is absolutely essential that we get this right.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo,Return of bodies marks day of anguish for Israel,"On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading. The return of the dead. It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days. Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put. But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Missile casings bore the slogan: ""They were killed by US bombs"". Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified. As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion. Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away. The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain. After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi. A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place. Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters. In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre. All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023. Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands. The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri. ""We were devastated by the news,"" Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir. ""I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."" Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023. Oded was 84 years old at the time. He and his wife, Yocheved, were both taken to Khan Younis in Gaza, where they were separated, never to see each other again. Yocheved was released by Hamas two weeks after the attack. ""We need to close this wound and move forward,"" Yizhar said, adding that his father, a noted journalist and peace activist, had long had a vision about how to resolve the conflicts of the Middle East. ""It's sad that we went through this whole cycle and didn't solve it,"" Yizhar said. ""We left it as something simmering, and look where we are now."" Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip. In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. It says some have been held for decades. ""I don't like this agreement at all,"" Ikram Abu Salout said in Khan Younis. ""They didn't remove the rubble and we don't even know where our children and families are."" As she was speaking, bulldozers flying Egyptian flags were finally arriving in northern Gaza. Israel allowed the equipment to enter, in exchange for Thursday's handover and the release of six more living hostages this coming Saturday.",2025-02-20T13:50:46.056Z,Paul Adams
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly48reeg55o,'I cried for days': Office raids and arrests shock aid workers in Yemen,"When Hanaa arrived at work a few months ago, she found ""drawers and doors smashed, and the boss surrounded by security personnel"". Computers, phones, cameras and documents were all confiscated, her boss was arrested and the organisation's bank account was eventually frozen. Hanaa works for a US-funded non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Yemen, that supports women's empowerment and trains people to solve problems through negotiation. But the country's civil war, which has lasted more than a decade and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, has made life for NGO workers increasingly dangerous. Twenty-four UN employees, along with workers from other local and international NGOs have been detained by Houthi rebels in the past few months. A wave of arrests in January has intensified the climate of fear - one person from the World Food Programme who was detained died in custody. The situation has left humanitarian workers feeling their freedom of movement has been greatly restricted. As a result, many organisations, including the UN, are scaling back operations, threatening to make life for people already devastated by war even worse. Ten years ago, Iranian-backed Houthi militants seized control of much of the west of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, from the internationally-recognised government. Saudi Arabia, has since carried out intensive air raids on its neighbour - with logistical and intelligence support from the US and UK - to try to prevent the Houthi rebels from taking control of the whole country. It was Houthi officials who raided Hanaa's office and detained her boss, and she fears retribution if she speaks out. So, for their safety, we have changed the names of Hanaa and others in Yemen who we interviewed for this article. By cracking down on humanitarian workers, Hanaa believes the Houthis aim to spread fear among the public. But what hurts her deeply is how the public reacted. ""When I checked social media, it was appalling to find out that people see us as spies,"" she says. A day after her boss was detained, Hanaa was glued to her TV, watching a pro-Houthi channel airing what it described as confessions of espionage, made by nine local people who had once worked at the long-closed US embassy in Sanaa. They were arrested in 2021. That was the moment she feared things would get worse for her, as she worked for a US-funded NGO. She decided to leave her home in northern Yemen. By the time she reached the south, she felt traumatised. ""For three days I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't stop crying,"" she says. Now she's worried that US President Donald Trump's decision to re-designate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation could lead them to target everyone who works in US-funded projects. Once someone is arrested, it can be hard for them to get any support, according to Yemeni lawyer Abdulaziz, who represents 14 detainees. They have been behind bars for several months - three are UN staff, while the others are employed by local NGOs. ""During the first three months of detention, my clients didn't communicate with anyone,"" he says. Abdulaziz is getting increasingly worried that their whereabouts is still unknown. More recently, he says that his clients were able to make a few brief phone calls to their families. ""Each call was between five to 10 minutes,"" he explains. The BBC approached the Houthis to ask about their treatment of aid workers, but got no reply. In addition to the detentions, lifesaving assistance from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been paused as a result of President Trump's freeze on the organisation's operations around the world, amid allegations of waste and misuse of funds. Human Rights Watch (HRW) warns that that the impact of President Trump's policies and the Houthis' arbitrary arrests is ""nothing short of devastating"". It ""will have massive and dramatic impact on aid provision in Yemen"", says Niku Jafarnia, a Yemen and Bahrain researcher at the organisation. According to HRW, the US was funding about one third of humanitarian aid in Yemen, much of it through USAID. Between 2015 and 2021, it provided more than $3.6 billion, making it the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance in the country, according to the UN. ""Cutting aid would be a death sentence to us,"" warns Amal, a mother of nine. She lives in a camp for internally displaced people in northern Yemen, alongside thousands of other families. Even over the phone, it is clear what a heavy burden this woman is carrying. Her slow speech is laden with emotion. It is nearly 10 years since she lost her home. Amal singlehandedly supports her huge family. Her husband has acute asthma, so he can't work. The family had to flee their hometown further north after the conflict began. Since then, life has been increasingly unkind to them. The camp, on barren desert land, hardly resembles a home. Their only shelter is a worn-out plastic tent, with no chairs or beds. It is hard for her children to find joy in a place which lacks almost everything. ""If this supply line provided by NGOs is cut, my children might die. We have no jobs, no income, nothing,"" Amal adds.  About half of the population are in bad need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 10 million children, according to the UN children's charity Unicef. The UN Human Development Index lists Yemen as one of the 10 least developed countries in the world. Amal tells us she receives a monthly food basket from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), but it barely lasts two weeks. When they run out of food, she says her only option is to leave the camp and go out begging in the city's streets. She passes restaurants and shops, hoping for a few loaves of bread or a packet of rice. ""I am covered in shame, but should I leave my children to starve? I am totally helpless,"" Amal explains. Helplessness often takes its toll on her. ""I cry a lot when I realise that I don't have a penny,"" she says, her voice both anguished and bitter. A large number of children suffer from diarrhoea and pneumonia due to the poor hygiene, malnutrition and miserable living conditions, but adequate medication is rarely available. At a clinic in northern Yemen, the shelves where medicines should be lie empty. Staff told us the medical stock they have is nothing compared to the people's needs. The BBC contacted the UN seeking comment on the current aid distribution process and recent arrests but received no reply.  However, addressing the UN Security Council, Hans Grundberg, the UN Special envoy for Yemen, condemned the detention of its staff as ""not only a violation of fundamental human rights, but also a direct threat to the UN's ability to distribute aid to the most needy"". He also called for the immediate release of all detainees, whether from the UN or from other local and international NGOs. It is for families like Amal's that Hanaa and her co-workers try to make life better. She proudly remembers how they sent girls to school in one of the conservative northern areas. When parents complained about neighbours being able to see their daughters during break time, ""we held discussions between residents, and eventually agreed to cover the playground, so that girls could go back to class"", she explains. She fears that the absence of this support, due to fear and lack of funds, could increase rates of illiteracy. ""We are the only ones who have survived during the collapse of the state, in order to serve the people,"" Hanaa says with a sigh. The names of Hanaa, Abdulaziz and Amal were changed for this article.",2025-02-20T01:08:10.778Z,Sally Nabil
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o,Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family,"Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group. The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack. Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this. The children's father Yarden was released by Hamas earlier this month. Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned. In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt. In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed ""handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family"". Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives. An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named. In a statement, the Bibas family said: ""In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase. ""We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter. ""Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over. Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday. They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time. The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day. They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri. Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun. Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel. But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war. Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin ""this week"". He said Israel would ""not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza"" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive. ""If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer,"" Saar said. A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals. Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave.",2025-02-19T06:29:15.395Z,Gabriela Pomeroy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9e9wlp101o,"Couple held in Iran need 'prompt' UK action, says Nazanin's husband","The UK government must act ""more promptly"" to help a British couple currently being held in Iran than it did to secure the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, her husband Richard Ratcliffe has said. Craig and Lindsay Foreman were arrested in January, but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, only emerged earlier this week. The couple, both aged 52, had been on a motorbike trip across the world and had only planned to be in Iran for five days. Mr Ratcliffe, whose wife was arrested in Iran in 2016 and not released until six years later, said the dangers of travelling to the country would be ""a lot clearer"" if Foreign Office travel advice reflected ""the risks of hostage-taking"" there. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention"". Having a British passport or connections to the UK ""can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you"", it adds. The Foreman family said the couple's detention was a ""distressing situation"" and they are ""deeply focused on ensuring their safety and wellbeing during this trying time"". Responding to the case, Mr Ratcliffe told the PA news agency: ""My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are not in for a long ordeal, and that the government is able to respond more promptly than it did in our case. ""I do think the risks would be a lot clearer to people if the UK travel advice to Iran talked about the risks of hostage-taking. People would be more alert to the fact that it is not personal, and it doesn't matter whether you have travelled there with a good heart."" Posting on Instagram before being detained, Mrs Foreman acknowledged travelling to Iran, against Foreign Office advice, and to Pakistan was risky and ""slightly scary"". But she wrote ""we know the rewards of meeting incredible people, hearing their stories, and seeing the breathtaking landscapes of these regions could far outweigh the fear"". Mr Ratcliffe said the ""top priority"" for the UK government should be ensuring Mr and Mrs Foreman were not being held in solitary confinement, because it was ""important they do not feel alone"". He added a court process in the case may happen soon but said: ""It's not a real court... it will be a form of brutal theatre to get the government's attention. And it will hurt much the same. I really hope they will be okay."" The UK Foreign Office did not respond directly to Mr Ratcliffe's comments when approached by BBC News, but said it was providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran and is in contact with the local authorities. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian national, was arrested at an airport in Tehran in April 2016 and accused of spying charges, which she denied. Mr Ratcliffe went on hunger strike twice as part of his campaign for his wife's release. She was ultimately freed and returned to Britain in March 2022 after the UK government agreed to settle a £400m debt dating back to the 1970s. Mr and Mrs Foreman were heading for Australia on their journey across the globe and had crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December. They planned to be in Pakistan by 4 January. After staying in the cities of Tabriz, Tehran and Isfahan, accompanied by a tour guide, they travelled on to Kerman, in east-central Iran, but never checked into their hotel there. The Iranian authorities have not said what the couple are accused of. In a series of social media posts before they were detained, the pair described their joy at being in Iran. Mrs Foreman, a life coach with a doctorate in psychology, said she was ""having an amazing time"". Her husband Craig, who is a carpenter, spoke of the ""lovely people"" of a ""lovely country"". The couple had moved from East Sussex to start a new life in Andalucia, Spain, in 2019 and appeared on an episode of Channel 4's A New Life in the Sun in 2022 to showcase their lives as expats. Mrs Foreman is reported to have been carrying out a research project on their journey to Australia, asking people what it means to be human and what constitutes a good life. She was due to present her findings at a conference on positive psychology in Brisbane in July.",2025-02-16T18:21:22.966Z,David Mercer
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4egp7lwno,Iran's abandoned bases in Syria: Years of military expansion lie in ruins,"Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria. The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks. Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war. Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its ""security belt"" against Israel. We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups. From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base. A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi - named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024. The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria. The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation. ""Iranians were here. They all fled,"" one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. ""Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods."" Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated. The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf. They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria. Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian ""military advisers"" and their Iranian commanders. Tehran's main justification for its military involvement in Syria was ""to fight against jihadi groups"" and to protect ""Shia holy shrines"" against radical Sunni militants. It created paramilitary groups of mainly Afghan, Pakistani and Iraqi fighters. Yet, when the final moment came, Iran was unprepared. Orders for retreat reached some bases at the very last moment. ""Developments happened so fast,"" a senior member of an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group tells me. ""The order was to just take your backpack and leave."" Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians. An HTS fighter, Mohammad al Rabbat, had witnessed the group's advance from Idlib to Aleppo and Syria's capital Damascus. He says they thought their operation would take ""about a year"" and best, they'd ""capture Aleppo in three to six months"". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days. The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel. That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally – the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike. This ""situation of psychological collapse"" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat. But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says. ""There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel."" As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters. On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: ""Down with Israel"" and ""Down with the USA"". It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated at short notice. We found documents classified as ""highly sensitive"". Abdullah, 65, and his family are among the very few locals who stayed and lived here alongside the IRGC-led groups. He says this life was hard. His house is only a few metres away from the headquarters and in between, there are deep trenches with barbed wire. ""Movement at night was prohibited,"" he says. His neighbour's home was turned into a military post. ""They sat there with their guns pointing at the road, treating us all as suspects,"" he recalls. Most of the fighters didn't even speak Arabic, he says. ""They were Afghans, Iranians, Hezbollah. But we referred to them all as Iranians because Iran was controlling them."" Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the ""Iranian militias"" have left, but still remembers the ""stressful"" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then ""they just vanished in a few hours"". ""This was an occupation. Iranian occupation,"" says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base. I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians. I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was. ""Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it,"" he explained. This feeling is reflected in Syria's new rulers' policy towards Iran. The new authorities have put a ban on Iranian nationals, alongside Israelis, entering Syria. But there is no such ban against Russians. Iran's embassy, which was stormed by angry protesters after the fall of the regime, remains closed. The reaction of Iranian officials towards developments in Syria has been contradictory. While supreme leader Ali Khamenei called on ""Syrian youths"" to ""resist"" those who ""have brought instability"" to Syria, Iran's foreign ministry has taken a more balanced view. It says the country ""backs any government supported by the Syrian people"". In one of his first interviews, Syria's new leader Sharaa described their victory over Assad as an ""end of the Iranian project"". But he hasn't ruled out having a ""balanced"" relationship with Tehran. For the moment, though, Iran is not welcome in Syria. After years of expanding its military presence, everything Tehran built is now in ruins, both on the battlefield and, it seems, in the eyes of a large part of Syria's public. Back at the abandoned base, Iran's military expansion was still under way even in the last days. Next to the camp were more tunnels under construction, apparently the beginnings of a field hospital. The cement on the walls was still wet and the paint fresh. But left behind now is evidence of a brief fight - a few bullet shells and a military uniform covered with blood.",2025-02-16T00:15:40.299Z,Nafiseh Kohnavard
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g7n3l98z6o,Israeli hostages and Palestinian inmates freed in latest ceasefire swap,"Hamas has released another three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners following a week in which the fragile ceasefire deal appeared under threat. American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Argentinian-Israeli Yair Horn, 46, and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29, were freed in return for 369 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. So far 19 hostages and more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have been freed in the first phase of ceasefire deal which began on 19 January. The swap came days after Hamas said it would pause the release of hostages, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the deal - an allegation denied by Israel. Israel, backed by US President Donald Trump, said ""intense"" fighting would resume unless the hostages were handed over. Hamas later said it remained committed to the ceasefire, and that Israel was ""responsible for any complications or delays"". But on Saturday the sixth swap went ahead, with the hostages handed over to Red Cross workers in a highly-choreographed public show in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. Surrounded by heavily armed Hamas militants, the men briefly addressed a crowd of Palestinians before being transferred into Red Cross vehicles. They did not look as gaunt as the hostages freed a week earlier - their appearance had aroused anger in Israel and elsewhere. Under the first six-week stage of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are supposed to be freed. The three men were airlifted by military helicopters to a hospital in central Israel, where they underwent medical tests and were reunited with relatives. Yair Horn and his brother Eitan, 37, had been abducted from a kibbutz during the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas. Eitan remains in captivity in Gaza. Pictures showed Yair Horn hugging his mother and his brother Amos in hospital, and a message where he wrote ""Eitan, you're next"". US citizen Sagui Dekel-Chen also reunited with his wife, where he learned that he had one-year-old daughter. His wife had been eight months pregnant with their third child when he was captured by Hamas in October 2023. US President Donald Trump marked the hostage release on Saturday, noting Hamas had not followed through with their threat. ""They seem to be in good shape,"" he said. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, posting on social media, said the hostages had been ""forced to endure"" a ""despicable and cynical ceremony"". In a social media post, Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to work with the US to ""ensure that all hostages return to Israel soon"". The majority of the freed Palestinians were taken to Gaza, although some were taken to the West Bank. In both areas, crowds gathered to welcome the former prisoners. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society told the BBC that five of those released in the West Bank city of Ramallah were taken straight to hospital. ""They all have chronic illnesses,"" said Mohammad Faqih, an official from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, adding that one man had a broken leg. Most of the 36 Palestinians serving life sentences will reportedly be deported to Egypt. The latest releases mean that under the ceasefire, Hamas is due to free another 14 hostages. However Israel says eight are of them are dead, meaning six living Israelis are still expected to be returned in the first phase. A total of 141 hostages have now been freed, including 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals released as part of a previous deal between Israel and Hamas. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says.",2025-02-15T17:11:31.416Z,Henri Astier

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4m3wx9w04o,Gaza plans put Egypt-US relations to tough test,"In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home. In the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire. Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza. But now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to ""a parcel of land"" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat. Egyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check. ""We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!"" says Abdo, a civil engineer. ""The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them. This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence."" Others stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt. To try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz. He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally. Egypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East. Since Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally. Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty. Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance. However, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism. American military aid ""does not constitute any value to Egypt,"" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said. He insisted Egyptians refuse ""pressure"" or ""blackmail"". Egypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans. Egyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled. Egypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive. The hope now is that by devising its own ""masterplan"" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy. The Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (£16bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away. The plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: ""I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt."" Various ""innovative ideas"" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction. Speaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states ""don't like"" the Trump Gaza plan. ""Now, if someone has a better plan – and we hope they do,"" he went on, ""now's the time to present it."" Some Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative ""comprehensive vision"" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February. Proposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role. Egypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects. However, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging. The former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge. But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood. Egypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to ""achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause."" Back outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history. Already Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil. Ultimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US. ""Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!"" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name. ""The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA. ""I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences.""",2025-02-14T16:58:09.271Z,Yolande Knell in Jerusalem and Wael Hussein in Cairo
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnwnz1ldko,"Starved, threatened and abused: Parents of freed Hamas hostages give details of ordeal","Parents of four young female Israeli hostages freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza have told the BBC about how their daughters were abused, including being starved, intimidated and threatened by armed men, and forced to cook and clean. They recounted how the hostages were held in underground tunnels and buildings, witnessed physical abuse and were made to participate in Hamas propaganda videos, including, in one case, by faking her own death. They said the women found strength through sharing stories, drawing and keeping a diary. None of the women have given interviews to the media since their release, and their parents say the full details of what they endured are still emerging. There are also things they can't speak about due to fears it could put the hostages still in Gaza at risk. Three of the four women whose parents spoke to the BBC were female soldiers kidnapped by Hamas from the Nahal Oz army base near Gaza on 7 October 2023. The hostages' access to food and their treatment by male guards varied over the 15 months they were held, their parents said. They were moved between locations, rarely seeing sunlight. ""It was very different between the places that she went - it could be a good tunnel, it could be a very bad tunnel. It could be a good house or a bad house,"" said the father of Agam Berger, 20, a soldier who had been at Nahal Oz. Some of the places had good food, some had ""very bad food... they just tried to survive,"" Shlomi Berger said. ""They [and their captors] had to run away from one place to another because they are in a war zone there. It was very dangerous to be there,"" said Orly Gilboa, whose daughter Daniella was also kidnapped from the base. When Daniella watched the release of three male hostages last week - who came out thin and emaciated - she told her mother: ""If I had been released two months ago I would have probably looked like them."" ""She got thinner, she lost a lot of her weight through the captivity. But in the last two months they were given a lot of food to gain weight,"" Ms Gilboa says. Other parents have also reported significant weight loss. Meirav Leshem Gonen's daughter was taken by Hamas from the Nova music festival. Romi, 24, was released in the first week of the ceasefire in January - she had lost ""20% of her body weight"", says her mother. Ms Gilboa says the hardest thing she endured was seeing a video that suggested her daughter had been killed. Her captors poured powder on her so she looked like she was covered in plaster, as if she was killed in an Israeli military strike. ""I think everyone who saw it believed it, but I just kept telling myself that it can't be,"" she told the BBC. The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage. More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been destroyed or damaged, estimates the UN. So far, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been exchanged for more than 600 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel under the ceasefire deal that began on 19 January. Mr Berger says his daughter, Agam, was threatened by her captors and witnessed physical abuse while in captivity. ""Sometimes they tortured other female hostages in front of her eyes,"" he says, referring specifically to an assault on Amit Soussana, a former hostage who was released in November 2023. Mr Berger says his daughter told him how they were constantly watched over by armed men, ""playing all the time with their guns and their hand grenades"". He says the male captors treated the women with ""big disrespect"", including forcing them to clean and prepare food. ""That was really bothering her. She's a girl that if she has something to say, she'll say it. She's not shy. And sometimes she told them what she was thinking about them and their behaviour,"" he says. He adds that in a small act of resistance, Agam had refused to perform any jobs on the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. The men detaining her accepted this. They were also not allowed to speak loudly. ""When Agam came [back to Israel] she wanted to speak all the time... After a day, she had no voice because she'd spoken so much,"" Mr Berger says. Yoni Levy, whose daughter Naama, 20, was also taken from the army base, says she was sometimes held in locations where there was a TV or radio playing. Once, Naama saw her father talking on TV. ""It gave her a lot of hope and optimism... that nobody would forget her, and we'll do whatever is needed to take her out of this hell."" He says for Naama, the Hamas attack on the army base was ""much more traumatic than the captivity itself"". ""It may change but at this stage we think that this is the most tragic day that she's talked about,"" Mr Levy says. Footage of Naama that day shows her and other female soldiers in bloodstained clothing surrounded by armed men in a room at the base before being forced into a vehicle and taken to Gaza. The three female soldiers whose parents spoke to the BBC are among five from an all-women unarmed military unit at Nahal Oz freed in the first round of the ceasefire. Members of the unit, known in Hebrew as Tatzpitaniyot, are tasked with observing the Gaza border and looking for signs of anything suspicious. Survivors and relatives of some of those killed that day say that they had been warning for months that Hamas had been preparing for an attack. A few days before the 7 October attack, Daniella had been at home on a break from service. She had told her mother then: ""Mummy, when I go back to the army, there's going to be a war."" ""I didn't think it was going to be such a war and of course that my daughter would be taken hostage,"" Ms Gilboa says. Ms Gilboa and the families of the two other observers who spoke to the BBC say they are joining calls for an inquiry into what happened. They say their daughters remain concerned about the conditions of those still in Gaza and have called for the ceasefire to continue. Meanwhile, Ms Leshem Gonen says she is still learning what happened to her daughter Romi. She was shot at the Nova music festival and her mother says she was not properly treated, leaving her with ""an open wound where she could see the bone"". ""This is something we can know and that she speaks about. The other things, I think it will take time."" Ms Leshem Gonen says Romi described her release in the first week of the truce as ""intimidating"" and ""frightening"". She was surrounded by gunmen and crowds. But the moment of their reunion was ""so powerful"". The parents also described how their daughters had found ways to get through each day in captivity - through drawing, making notes or sharing stories with each other. ""They wrote as much as they could, every day - what was happening, where were they moving, who were the guards and things like that,"" says Mr Berger. While in captivity, the young women had dreamt about the things they wanted to do when they got home: getting a haircut and eating sushi. Daniella had drawn a butterfly with the word ""freedom"" while in captivity - she now has that tattooed on her arm. They are adapting to life back in Israel, and their families say they are taking the recovery step by step. The moment of reunion with his daughter Naama is still a blur, says Mr Levy, but he remembers the emotion. ""The feeling was that... I will take care of you now, and everything's going to be OK. Daddy's here. That's all. And then everything was quiet."" Additional reporting by Naomi Scherbel-Ball",2025-02-13T18:30:33.818Z,Alice Cuddy
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vpqr6511yo,Hamas says it will continue releasing Israeli hostages under Gaza deal,"Hamas has said it is committed to implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel and will continue releasing hostages as scheduled, raising hopes that a resumption of the war can be averted. Following talks in Cairo, the Palestinian armed group said mediators from Egypt and Qatar had confirmed they would ""remove obstacles"". Egyptian and Qatari reports also said gaps had been bridged. An Israeli government spokesman did not comment on the reports but stated that if Hamas did not free three living hostages on Saturday then the ceasefire would end. Israel's prime minister made a similar ultimatum on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing releases over what it claimed were Israeli violations. Hamas said these included a failure to allow in the agreed amounts of vital humanitarian aid, including tents and shelters, which Israel denied. The group's threat to derail the deal prompted US President Donald Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and ""let hell break out"" unless ""all of the hostages"" were returned by Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Trump's demand and warned: ""If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end and the [Israeli military] will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas."" However, there were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether he was demanding the release of all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with Trump's ultimatum - or just the three due to be freed this weekend. On Wednesday, an Egyptian security source told the BBC that Egypt and Qatar were ""intensifying their diplomatic efforts in an attempt to salvage the ceasefire agreement"", as Hamas's leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, arrived in Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's intelligence chief and other officials. After concluding the talks on Thursday morning, Hamas put out a statement saying they focused on the need for all terms of the deal to be fulfilled, particularly regarding deliveries of caravans, tents, heavy construction equipment, medical supplies and fuel. It added that the talks were ""positive"" and that the mediators had agreed to work to ""remove obstacles and close gaps"". ""Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to implementing the agreement as signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timeline."" At the same time, Egyptian state-run Al Qahera TV reported that Egypt and Qatar had successfully ""overcome obstacles"" and that Israel and Hamas were committed to fully implementing the ceasefire deal. Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV also said the negotiations had been successful and that mobile homes and heavy machinery would be allowed into Gaza on Thursday. However, Israeli media then cited the Israeli prime minister's office as calling the Al Jazeera report ""fake news"" and saying there was ""no basis"" to it. Omer Dostri, a spokesman for the prime minister, later clarified the denial, writing on X: ""There is no entry of caravans or heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip, and there is no co-ordination for this."" When asked about Hamas's statement at a later media briefing, another Israeli government spokesman said Israel's position on the ceasefire agreement was ""crystal clear"". ""There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages,"" David Mencer said. ""That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday."" ""If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages, by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end."" War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war. ""When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices,"" Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. ""I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall."" The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza. So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal. The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named. Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the remaining 59 hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun. The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",2025-02-13T17:28:43.330Z,David Gritten
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5k6rk3gkno,Two British nationals detained in Iran,"Two British nationals - a man and a woman - have been arrested in Iran, the Foreign Office has confirmed. News of their arrest first came from state-run media in Iran which said they were in custody in the south-eastern city of Kerman, accused of unspecified security-related offences. It did not name them but published a photograph of them with their faces blurred, meeting the British ambassador, Hugo Shorter, at the prosecutor's office in Kerman on Wednesday. The Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to Iran, saying that British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk"" of arrest, questioning or detention. ""Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you,"" the advice says. Also at the meeting between the Britons and the UK ambassador were Kerman's prosecutor Mehdi Bakhshi and the deputy governor general for security and law enforcement affairs Rahman Jalali, state news agency IRNA reported. Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency in recent years, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK. Human rights groups say they are often held for leverage, released only when Iran gets something in return. In 2023, Iran executed British-Iranian dual national Alireza Akbari, who had been convicted of spying for the UK. He denied the charge and said he had been tortured and forced to confess on camera to crimes he did not commit. Later that year, environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, a UK-US-Iranian citizen, was among five people released as part of a prisoner swap deal between Iran and the US that also saw $6bn (£4.8bn) of frozen Iranian funds transferred from South Korea. British-Iranian citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released in 2022 and allowed to leave Iran after the UK settled a long-standing £650m debt owed to Iran.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7g474px2do,WFP says worker died in detention in Houthi-controlled Yemen,"A World Food Programme (WFP) worker has died while in detention in Houthi-controlled northern Yemen, according to the UN agency. The WFP said the man was one of seven Yemeni staff ""arbitrarily detained"" by local authorities since 23 January. It is unclear when or how he died. His death was announced a day after the UN said it would be pausing all operations in the northern governorate of Saada, a stronghold of the Iran-backed Houthi movement, over safety concerns. The UN said it followed the detention by the Houthis of eight additional UN personnel, including six in Saada. More than 60 staff from the UN, international non-governmental organisations and foreign embassies were already being held. ""This extraordinary and temporary measure seeks to balance the imperative to stay and deliver with the need to have the safety and security of the UN personnel and its partners guaranteed,"" UN spokesman Farhan Haq said. In a post on X on Tuesday, WFP executive director Cindy McCain said the worker who died in detention was named Ahmed and that he was a ""devoted humanitarian and father of 2"" who had helped deliver life-saving food assistance. According to the WFP, he had been working for the agency since 2017. McCain said she was ""heartbroken and outraged by the tragic loss"". ""Humanitarians are #NotATarget,"" she added. There was no immediate comment from Houthi authorities. Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated 10 years ago, when the Houthis seized control of the north-west from the internationally-recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US and UK intervened in an effort to restore its rule. The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid. Last month, the UN said it was actively engaging with senior Houthi officials to try to secure the release of all its detained employees. Even though they provide a vital lifeline, UN agencies have regularly had problems reaching people in more remote areas outside the major towns and cities, with Houthi officials regularly reported to have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Human rights groups have also accused the movement of kidnapping, torturing and arbitrarily detaining hundreds of civilians. In June, the Houthis claimed they had dismantled an ""American-Israeli spy network"" following the detention of 13 UN staff, as well as more than 50 NGO workers and an embassy staff member. The UN human rights chief said the allegation was baseless. The UN Security Council is due to discuss the situation in Yemen later this week. Last month, US President Donald Trump put the Houthis back on his country's list of designated foreign terrorist organisations over their attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel.",2025-02-11T13:49:53.327Z,Alex Smith
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77rg752nj7o,"Elderly hostage in Gaza was killed in 7 October attack, Israel says","The Israeli military has said an elderly Israeli man was killed during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and that his body is being held hostage in Gaza. Iraq-born Shlomo Mansour, 86, was abducted by gunmen at his home in Kibbutz Kissufim. His wife, Mazal, managed to escape. The military said the decision to confirm Shlomo's death was based on intelligence gathered in recent months and was approved by an expert committee of the ministry of health. His name is on the Israeli government's list of 33 hostages to be released by Hamas during the first phase of a ceasefire deal that is coming under growing strain. So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails since 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages. The remaining 17 Israeli hostages - two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50 - are supposed to be released over the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of those hostages are dead but not named them. On Monday, Hamas warned that it would postpone the scheduled release of the next group of three this weekend unless US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators addressed what it said were Israeli violations of the deal, including delays in allowing in shelters and medical supplies. The threat prompted US President Donald Trump to propose that Israel cancel the deal and ""let hell break out"" if Hamas did not release all the hostages by midday on Saturday. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said Hamas's move was a complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and told the Israeli military to prepare for any possible scenario in Gaza. Shlomo Mansour was born in Baghdad and as a child survived the Farhud pogrom against the Iraqi capital's Jewish community in 1941. He emigrated to Israel with his family at the age of 13 and went on to help found Kibbutz Kissufim, where he worked in the chicken coop and eyewear factory. On 7 October 2023, hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen stormed the Israel's Gaza perimeter fence and attacked many nearby Israeli communities, including Kissufim. They killed about 1,200 people were killed and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Shlomo and Mazal - who had five children and 12 grandchildren - fled to their home's safe room that day, but a group of gunmen fired at the door and were able to break it open. Mazal hid in the bathroom, but they found Shlomo, handcuffed him, and took him out of the house. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had informed the Mansour family that he was then murdered by the gunmen and that they took his body back to Gaza as a hostage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife, Sara, sent their heartfelt condolences to the family following the ""bitter news"". ""We will neither rest nor be silent until he is returned for burial in Israel,"" he added. ""We will continue to take determined and relentless action until we return all of our hostages - the living and the deceased."" The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents some of the hostages' relatives, said: ""We share in the profound grief of the Mansour family."" On Monday, in response to Hamas's threat to postpone the next hostage release, the forum called on mediators to help restore and implement the ceasefire deal effectively so that the remaining 76 hostages are brought home. ""Recent evidence from those released, as well as the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday, leaves no room for doubt - time is of the essence, and all hostages must be urgently rescued from this horrific situation,"" it warned. The Israeli government was furious at the emaciated state of Eli Sharabi, 52, Ohad Ben Ami, 56, and Or Levy, 34, who were paraded in front of a crowd in Deir al-Balah before being handed over to the Red Cross. An Israeli doctor who treated Mr Sharabi and Mr Levy said they were in a ""poor medical condition"", while a hospital official said Mr Ben Ami was in a ""severe nutritional sate and had lost a significant amount of his body weight"". Meanwhile, the family of another hostage, Alon Ohel, 24, said on Sunday they had received their first indication in 16 months that he was alive from Mr Levy and Mr Sharabi, who were held captive along with him. ""Since his kidnapping, Alon has been held in harsh conditions in Hamas's underground tunnels, without daylight or access to basic human necessities,"" a statement said. ""We have been informed that Alon is wounded in his eye. Additionally, he is being held in particularly severe captivity conditions, with serious food shortages."" The Ohel family also urged the Israeli government to advance negotiations with Hamas on the ceasefire deal's second phase, which should see the remaining living hostages released, a permanent ceasefire, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. More than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",2025-02-11T11:49:34.042Z,David Gritten
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd649p8yq16o,Paul Adams: Why the Gaza ceasefire is under growing strain,"Why has Hamas announced a delay just days before it is due to release the next group of hostages? In one of its official statements, released on Telegram, the group called its announcement a ""warning"" to Israel and said it was giving mediators ""ample time to pressure the occupation [Israel] into fulfilling its obligations"". It said the ""door remains open"" for the next scheduled releases to go ahead on Saturday. The group appears to be giving time for the impasse to be resolved. But what exactly is the impasse? Hamas lists a series of complaints, from delaying the return of displaced people, continuing to open fire on them and failing to allow the entry of certain types of humanitarian aid. Other Palestinian officials not connected with Hamas have cited Israel's reluctance to allow caravans into Gaza to house the vast numbers of Palestinians whose homes have been destroyed. At a time when the Israeli government is openly discussing ways to encourage civilians to leave Gaza, the failure to give permits for badly needed temporary accommodation is bound to stoke Palestinian fears of expulsion. Fears exacerbated, almost every day, by Donald Trump. What began as an apparently off-the-cuff suggestion that most Palestinians should leave while the Gaza Strip is rebuilt has morphed into the president's demand that all should leave and that the US should take over and run Gaza. As Trump continues to double down on his incendiary suggestion, Hamas may be wondering whether it's worth engaging in phase two of the ceasefire talks. What exactly are the talks for? If Trump is serious, the Palestinians know that it will fall to Israel to make sure that Gaza is devoid of civilians. Depriving them of shelter won't be enough. It will almost certainly require force. Now Trump has said that if all the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday he will propose cancelling the ceasefire and ""all hell"" will break out. But he did say he was speaking for himself and ""Israel can override it"". Faced with the possible resumption of war, Hamas may be wondering what incentive there is to release the remaining hostages. For relatives and friends of the hostages, the current impasse, and Trump's noisy intervention, is cause for fresh anxiety. ""Each of these statements or announcements, of course, make Hamas more stubborn,"" Dudi Zalmanovich told the BBC. His wife's nephew, Omer Shem Tov, is still being held by Hamas. ""I would prefer him to be less proactive,"" Mr Zalmanovich said of Trump. Israel has its own suspicions about the rationale behind Hamas's threatened delay. The spectacle of emaciated hostages being released at the weekend has raised fears that Hamas may not want the world to see others in even worse condition. On top of the televised scenes of well-armed Hamas fighters parading in broad daylight, and warnings from the former US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, that the group has recruited as many soldiers as it's lost during the war, not all Israelis believe the ceasefire can – or even should – hold. It's too early to say whether this carefully negotiated, staged process is about to collapse – as many have predicted it will – but after a mostly positive start, it's under increasing strain.",2025-02-11T02:02:42.640Z,Paul Adams
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ye69ey4pyo,"Hamas says it will postpone hostage release, blaming Israel","A spokesman for the armed wing of Hamas says the group is postponing the next scheduled release of Israeli hostages, blaming what he says are Israeli violations of the ceasefire deal. Three hostages held in Gaza are due to be freed on Saturday in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz called the Hamas announcement a ""complete violation of the ceasefire agreement"". Key Israeli ally US President Donald Trump has suggested the ceasefire should be cancelled if ""all"" the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday. ""I'd say they ought to be returned by 12 o'clock on Saturday... all of them, not in dribs and drabs, not two and one and three and four and two,"" he said. ""I'm speaking for myself,"" he stressed. ""Israel can override it."" Seventy-three hostages taken during Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, and three others taken a decade earlier, are still being held in Gaza. If hostages were not released, Trump added, ""All hell is going to break out."" Asked whether he meant retaliation from Israel, he said: ""You'll find out, and they'll find out too. Hamas will find out what I mean."" Katz said he had ordered the Israel Defense Forces to ""prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza and to protect the communities"". ""We will not allow a return to the reality of 7 October,"" the Israeli defence minister added. Hamas's announcement came shortly before people gathered in Tel Aviv to mark the 24th birthday of Israeli hostage Alon Ohel, his second in captivity. He was taken hostage from the Nova festival on 7 October 2023. Mia Goldstein, an attendee at the rally for Ohel, told the BBC there should be ""immense pressure"" to get the rest of hostages out, adding Hamas's delay was ""horrifying"". Michal Neeman, who took part in a protest in Tel Aviv following the announcement from Hamas, said the hostages ""should have been out a few months ago. You see the situation, they are dying there, and their blood is on this government's hands"". UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said ""any delays"" to the fragile ceasefire deal would be an issue and all parties involved should adhere to their previously stated agreements and timelines. Hamas has said the ""door remains open"" to the exchange going ahead on Saturday if Israel ""complies"" with its obligations, according to news agency AFP. Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to the north of Gaza, firing on people and failing to allow in agreed humanitarian aid. The group's announcement did not refer to Trump or US policy but it comes after strong remarks made last week by the US president about the US taking ownership of Gaza and redeveloping it. His proposal included the resettlement of Palestinians outside the territory and was praised as ""revolutionary and creative"" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The militant group's statement is the latest in a series of recriminatory actions between the two sides. Israel delayed by two days allowing displaced Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza, accusing Hamas of reneging on a commitment to free a female Israeli civilian hostage. Israel also recently briefly delayed buses taking Palestinian prisoners to be released into the occupied West Bank, after expressing anger over the way in which hostages were released through crowds of spectators in Gaza hours earlier. On Friday, Hamas exceeded by a short time a deadline to release the names of hostages to be freed on Saturday - as required under the ceasefire - prompting concern in Israel. This came after it accused Israel of failing to abide by its commitment to boost the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza –contradicting what had been described by the UN's humanitarian chief as a ""massive surge"". Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 prisoners. By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead. Hamas took 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked in October 2023. Israel launched a military campaign in response, killing at least 48,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",2025-02-11T00:51:48.446Z,Raffi Berg & Ruth Comerford

They wonder aloud whether Basel will ever be able to freely visit Yuval's home in Israel, whether Basel's village will get building permits, and whether they will one day have stability. For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality. Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages. The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature. It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham. In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death. ""It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this,"" Yuval told the BBC. ""I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now."" Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years. Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against ""illegal construction"", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot. Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land. On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN. More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe. In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence – the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006. Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen. Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a ""title deed"" to the West Bank and ""there's no such thing"" as occupation or settlements. When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time. The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there. According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the ""expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert"". Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages. In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers. Scenes from the film show a bulldozer destroying a primary school, a truck pouring mud into a well, and machinery crushing a home as villagers confront the army. A girl cries, and when her mother is asked if she has any other place to go she says: ""We have no other land."" The documentary also records intimate human moments, like when the mother, who moves into a cave, kisses her daughter and tells her: ""You're my love... Tomorrow will be a new day."" The film explores Basel and Yuval's friendship as well. Though they are around the same age and share similar values, their inequality is ever-present. While Yuval can travel freely in Israel and the West Bank, Basel cannot travel into Israel without a permit, as part of what it says are security measures. In the film, Basel laments that although he studied law, he could only find work in construction in Israel, and when he thinks about it too hard, ""I feel this huge depression."" The film does not shy away from the tension created by Yuval's identity, with one Palestinian asking him: ""How can we remain friends, when you come here, and it could be your brother or friend who destroyed my home?"" Yuval told the BBC he felt ""responsibility for what is happening to Basel's community"" because ""at the end of the day, the fuel in the bulldozers is my tax money"". Last year, Yuval faced a backlash for his acceptance speech for the best documentary award at the Berlin Film Festival, alongside Basel, in which he criticised a ""situation of apartheid"" and called for a ceasefire in Gaza. US filmmaker Ben Russell, who was there and wore a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, said he stood against ""genocide"" in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide. German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said the statements were ""shockingly one-sided and characterised by a deep hatred of Israel"", while Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner posted on social media that it was an ""intolerable relativisation"" and that ""antisemitism has no place in Berlin"". Israel's public broadcaster called Yuval's comments antisemitic. Yuval, who said he received death threats, told the BBC he was ""very angry"" at the label, which was ""emptying this term of meaning at a time when antisemitism is rising on the right wing and on the left wing"". He said it was ""absurd"" to hear the criticism when most of his family was killed in the Holocaust, adding that learning from this history ""should tell us to fight against dehumanisation… no matter who is the victim"". Despite winning several international awards, No Other Land is self-distributing in the US because it has not found an official distributor there – rare for a documentary which has been nominated for an Oscar. One of the film's last scenes is from 13 October 2023, when Basel recorded a settler shooting his cousin, whose hands appear empty, in the stomach. In other footage, settlers throw rocks at homes while soldiers watch. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the shooting case was transferred to the state attorney's office, which the BBC approached for comment. Currently in Masafer Yatta, Basel said settlers have ""unlimited power"" and there is a ""daily level of harassment"". He said there were three major settler attacks in January, including on a 72-year-old taken to hospital after he was hit in the head with sticks, and around 15 people arrested in the two days before 30 January while grazing their sheep or chasing away settlers' sheep. Israel Police did not reply to a BBC request for comment. The UK has sanctioned three settler outposts and four organisations it says are supporting violence against West Bank communities. Yuval called on the UK to sanction all settlers, believing that would ""truly be a deterrent"". A foreign office spokesperson told the BBC the foreign secretary ""has been clear with Israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settlement expansion"". ""We have regularly taken action against settler violence, including through targeted sanctions, and will continue to do all we can to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected and that those responsible for violence are held to account,"" the statement read. Yuval said: ""I really believe there is no other way forward, other than reaching a just, fair political solution where Palestinians can be free, truly free, and our people, both of them, will have security and self-determination. ""It really makes me angry, not only that my government is going in the other way, but that the world is allowing it to happen for so long."" In the film, Basel recalls a seven-minute visit by Tony Blair to his village – after which Israel cancelled demolition orders there. ""This is a story about power,"" he says. Now, Basel gets ""strength and power from the people around me"", making him want to not give up. ""One water drop doesn't make change,"" he says during a protest in the film, ""but keep dropping the water and it will make change.""",2025-02-07T02:01:10.243Z,Mallory Moench
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqldpyn5ng6o,Israeli soldier jailed for abusing Palestinian detainees from Gaza,"An Israeli military court has sentenced a soldier to seven months in prison after he admitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military detention centre. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the reservist, who it did not name, was convicted over ""several incidents in which he punched the detainees with his fists and used his weapon while they were handcuffed and blindfolded"". ""These acts were committed in the presence of other soldiers, some of whom called on him to stop, and were even documented on the defendant's mobile phone,"" it added. The Haaretz newspaper said he was the first soldier convicted of abusing Gazans held during the war with Hamas. He had made the Palestinians say demeaning phrases and make animal noises, and beat them while they were bound and blindfolded, Haaretz reported. It also cited the Beit Lid Military Court as saying the soldier admitted to three counts of aggravated abuse and one count of unbecoming conduct as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. They related to four separate incidents between January and June 2024, when he was guarding lorries transporting detainees, it said. According to Haaretz, the court found an unspecified number of masked soldiers, whose identities remain unknown, had also participated in the abuse. In addition to the prison term, the convicted soldier was also given a suspended sentence and demoted to the rank of private, according to the IDF. ""Soldiers have a duty to use the force entrusted to them in accordance with IDF values and orders, at all times and in times of war in particular,"" the IDF said. The Sde Teiman detention facility was set up after the start of the Gaza war 15 months ago. Since then, it has been at the centre of reports of serious abuses. In July, far-right protesters broke into Sde Teiman after Israeli military police went there to question nine reservists suspected of raping a detainee and causing a life-threatening injury to him. Several of the reservists were subsequently arrested. In October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been ""subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence"". Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was ""fully committed to international legal standards"". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 47,550 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. According to the Israeli rights group HaMoked, 1,802 Palestinians from Gaza are currently being held as ""unlawful combatants"" in Israeli prisons. The figure does not include detainees being held by the military.",2025-02-06T22:19:32.476Z,David Gritten
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78xre2ynd4o,'We won't go out of Gaza': Palestinians express shock and defiance at Trump plan,"For most Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip there is already a painful history of forced displacement that is at the heart of their response to US President Donald Trump's plan to take over the war-torn territory. Speaking to the BBC, residents of a tent camp in the central town of Deir al-Balah expressed shock and defiance at the idea of being permanently resettled outside. ""Even if it costs us our souls, we will not leave Gaza,"" said Mahmoud Bahjat, who is from the north. ""We are against Trump's decision. He ended the war but displacing us would end our lives."" On the other hand, many Israelis have been expressing satisfaction at the radical ideas from the White House, particularly those on the far-right who seek to resettle Gaza. Since a ceasefire took hold in Gaza - on the eve of Trump's inauguration last month - there have been dramatic scenes of Palestinians returning to what is left of their homes. Families have piled up possessions into cars and donkey carts or walked long distances along the coastal road, often just to reach piles of rubble. According to the UN, at least 1.9m people, or about 90% of the population, across Gaza became displaced during 15 months of war. The scenes of Palestinians on the move have echoed black-and-white footage from 1948 and the mass evacuations that took place during fighting before and after the creation of the state of Israel. More than 700,000 people were then forced from their homes. The majority of Gazans are descendants of those original refugees. Standing between rows of plastic sheeting in the Deir al-Balah camp, Jamalat Wadi says that her family has now sacrificed enough and that they are determined to build a new home. ""We endured a year and half of war. When [the Israeli military] finally withdraw from here, we want to remove the rubble and live on the land."" ""After the US made Israel destroy our houses in Gaza, he is telling us that Gaza is destroyed and we have to leave?"" Ms Wadi goes on. ""If there is only one drop of blood left in our children, we won't go out of Gaza. We won't give up on it!"" Many Palestinians we spoke to called on Jordan and Egypt - which Trump is pressing to take displaced Gazans - and for Saudi Arabia - which he wants to normalise relations with Israel - to hold out against US pressure. Since its establishment, Israel has rejected the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their historic homeland, as this would have left the Jewish people as a minority within its borders. Today, there are about 5.9m Palestinians registered by the UN, with most living in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Israel has long argued that those who were dispossessed should be absorbed by Arab countries, pointing out that thousands of Jews left these to come to Israel during the regional turmoil after it became a state. Israeli officials suggest that by proposing to take over war-torn Gaza, creating a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" after resettling Palestinians elsewhere, the Trump administration is offering fresh thinking on a long-running conflict. While Trump notably did not back the re-establishment of settlements in Gaza, settler leaders have reacted enthusiastically to the idea of displacement, calling on the Israeli government to act immediately. Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and began constructing settlements in both that are widely seen as illegal under international law. In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, although the UN still regards it as Israeli-occupied territory. ""Assuming Trump's declarations about transferring Gazans to other countries throughout the world actualise, we need to move quickly and build settlements throughout the Gaza Strip,"" stated the Nachala settlement organisation, which claims it has hundreds of activists ready to move there. ""No part of Israel should be left unsettled by Jews. If we leave any area desolate it is liable to be overtaken by our enemies,"" Nachala added. In contrast, the Israeli anti-occupation NGO, Peace Now, dismissed the Trump plan. It backs the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel as part of the long-standing international formula for peace in the region, known as the two-state solution. Peace Now said there was ""no feasible way to transfer two million Gazans"" outside. ""It's time to stop fantasising about ethnic cleansing and forced displacement in Gaza and face reality - there is only one solution that can guarantee security and stability in the Middle East: two states for two peoples and an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" it commented. Many Israelis and Palestinians are concerned about what the latest announcements could mean for the current talks on extending the Gaza ceasefire. The next stage of the deal is meant to see the return of some 60 remaining Israeli hostages - not all of whom are alive - and a more permanent end to the fighting. However, the brother of one Israeli hostage held by Hamas told us: ""I don't take what Trump says too seriously. It's not realistic. He's shooting for the stars."" He added that this was ""like with Canada"" - referring to the US leader's suggestions that it should become his country's ""51st state"". Some Gazans did acknowledge that they felt one aspect of President Trump's declaration was based on reality - his comments that the small coastal strip has become ""unliveable"". Last month, a UN damage assessment showed that clearing over 50m tonnes of rubble left in Gaza as a result of the heavy Israeli bombardment could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2bn. Bilal al-Rantisi, a former customs worker, is in shock after arriving back in Gaza City with his wife and four children having spent more than a year displaced in the south. ""We have returned to a catastrophe, the worst in history,"" he said despondently. ""I found neither my home nor my siblings' homes were standing. Trump doesn't speak in vain. He knows that Gaza is no longer a place fit for human habitation."" He said he was hoping to sell his car and his wife's gold jewellery to raise funds. ""I will leave Gaza at the earliest possible opportunity. Yes, all Gazans oppose displacement but putting emotions aside, if people were given the chance, many would choose to leave.""",2025-02-05T17:06:32.183Z,Yolande Knell
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo,Trump's Gaza plan will be seen as flying in face of international law,"When US President Donald Trump began speaking 10 days ago of Gaza as a demolition site, calling to ""clean out that whole thing"", it wasn't clear how far these were off-the-cuff remarks. But in the lead up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit, in his Oval Office comments before the meeting, and in the press conference itself, it's now clear he is profoundly serious about his proposals. They amount to the most radical upending in the established US position on Israel and the Palestinians in the recent history of the conflict; and will be seen as flying in the face of international law. As well as how the announcement will be absorbed by ordinary people on the ground, it could also have a significant impact on the more immediate phased ceasefire and hostage release process, at a critical juncture. Trump and his officials are framing his call to - in his language - permanently ""resettle"" all Palestinians out of Gaza as a humanitarian gesture, saying there is no alternative for them because Gaza is a ""demolition site"". Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations are strictly prohibited, and Palestinians as well as Arab nations will see this as nothing short of a clear proposal aimed at their expulsion and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land. That's why Arab leaders have already categorically rejected his ideas, made with increasing frequency over the last 10 days, when he suggested Egypt and Jordan could ""take"" Palestinians from Gaza. In a statement on Saturday, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League said that such a move could ""threaten the region's stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples"". It has long been a desire of the ultranationalist far right in Israel to expel Palestinians from the occupied territories and expand Jewish settlements in their place. Since the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, these groups – leaders of whom have been part of Netanyahu's coalition – have demanded the war against Hamas continues indefinitely, vowing ultimately to re-establish Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. They have continued their calls and opposed the current ceasefire and hostage release deal. In his White House press conference with the Israeli prime minister, Trump went further even than his recent growing calls for the Palestinians in Gaza to be ""relocated"" to Egypt and Jordan, saying that the United States would then take the territory over and rebuild it. When asked whether Palestinians would be allowed back, he said ""the world's people"" would live there, saying it would be an ""international, unbelievable place"", before adding ""also Palestinians"". His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier in the day summed up much of the tone around the proposal, saying of Trump ""this guy knows real estate"". Trump said it would be the ""Riviera of the Middle East"". Asked whether American troops would be involved in the take over of Gaza, Mr Trump said ""we'll do what is necessary"". His proposals amount to the most radical transformation in the US position on the territory since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the war of 1967, which saw the start of Israel's military occupation of land including the Gaza Strip. Gaza was already home to Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes in the wars surrounding Israel's creation. They and their descendants make up the vast majority of Gaza's population to this day. Trump's proposals, if enacted, would involve that population, now more than two million people, being forced elsewhere in the Arab world or even beyond, says Trump, to ""resettle… permanently"". The proposals would wipe out the possibility of a future two-state solution in any conventional sense and will be categorically rejected by Palestinians and the Arab world as an expulsion plan. Much of Netanyahu's political base and the ultranationalist settler movement in Israel will champion President Trump's words, seeing them as the fulfilment of a means as Netanyahu puts it to stop ""Gaza being a threat to Israel"". For ordinary Palestinians, it would amount to a mass act of collective punishment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwxj8108kno,Palestinian gunman kills Israeli soldiers as UN warns over W Bank operation,"Israel's military says two soldiers have been killed in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank, as its forces continue a major operation against Palestinian armed groups in the north of the territory. Another eight soldiers were wounded when a Palestinian gunman opened fire at a checkpoint in Tayasir village, 2km (1.2 miles) north of Tubas, a military statement said. The attacker was shot dead, it said. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad praised the attack as a response to the Israeli operation in Tubas, Jenin and Tulkarm, but neither said they were behind it. Meanwhile, a UN official warned the situation in Jenin's refugee camp was heading in a ""catastrophic direction"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the start of a large-scale operation to ""defeat terrorism"" in Jenin on 21 January, three days after the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took effect. The operation was expanded into Tulkarm and Tubas last week. The Palestinian health ministry says Israeli forces have killed 70 Palestinians across the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, since the start of the year. The figure includes the 25 reported killed in the Jenin area and 13 in the Tubas and Tulkarm areas over the past two weeks. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it killed about 55 ""terrorists"" and arrested 380 wanted individuals across the West Bank in January. Israeli media reported that the Palestinian who carried out Tuesday's shooting attack in Tayasir was able to sneak up to a military post next to the checkpoint before opening fire with an M16 rifle at soldiers stationed there. Soldiers fired back and a gun battle lasted several minutes before the attacker was killed, they said. The IDF named the two soldiers who were killed as Sgt Maj Ofer Yung, 39, and Sgt Maj Avraham Friedman, 43. Two of the eight wounded soldiers were in a serious condition in hospital, it said. During a visit to the scene later on Tuesday, the IDF's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, promised it would ""investigate and draw conclusions"" from what he described as the ""serious attack"". ""We will increase the counterterrorism activity and expand it to additional areas,"" he added. Hamas praised what it described as the ""heroic and qualitative operation carried out by a Palestinian resistance fighter"" in Tayasir, saying that it showed ""the crimes of the occupation and its aggression against the northern occupied West Bank will not go unpunished"". On Monday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman alleged that the Israeli operation was part of a wider effort aimed at ""displacing citizens and ethnic cleansing"". Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Tuesday, Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned of the deteriorating situation at Jenin refugee camp. Hundreds of Israeli security forces backed by helicopters, drones and armoured bulldozers have been carrying out raids in the camp, long seen as a stronghold of armed groups. ""Large parts of the camp were completely destroyed in a series of detonations by the Israeli forces. It is estimated that 100 houses were destroyed or heavily damaged,"" Ms Touma said. ""This detonation that happened on Sunday was when children were supposed to go back to school,"" she added. The IDF said on Sunday that it had ""dismantled"" 23 structures where explosives laboratories, weapons, observation posts and other infrastructure belonging to armed groups were located. Ms Touma also said that Unrwa, which has been unable to provide services in the camp since early December, had received no prior warning of the explosions from Israeli authorities. On Thursday, two laws passed by Israel's parliament last year which bans Unrwa activity on Israeli soil and forbids contact between Israeli officials and Unrwa employees came into force. Israeli officials accuse Unrwa of being complicit with Hamas - an allegation the agency denies. Ms Touma said the Israeli government had ""not communicated to Unrwa how they intend to implement"" the laws, and that Unrwa teams were currently ""staying and delivering"". There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.",2025-02-04T18:24:39.583Z,David Gritten
