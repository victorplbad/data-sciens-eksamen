Because as the following table compiled using OpenSecrets data, it cost JP Morgan just under $$1 million, or $$877,798.00 to be precise in lifetime campaign contributions, to buy itself precisely one Senate Banking Committee. And where it gets really fun is that between the Chairman, Tim Johnson (D – SD), and the ranking member Richard Shelby (R – AL), JP Morgan has been the top and second biggest campaign contributor, respectively.\n\nContinue Reading at ZeroHedge.com…\n\nRead more at Financial Survival Network\n\nSource:"

         "WHEN Julia Geist was asked to draw a picture of a computer scientist last year, the 16-year-old sketched a businessman wearing glasses and a tie. Looking around at her classmates’ drawings, she saw similar depictions of men.\n\nNow, Ms. Geist said, “I see a computer scientist could be anyone” — including herself.\n\nHer new perspective is a victory for Girls Who Code. As part of an eight-week program with the Manhattan-based nonprofit group, Ms. Geist and 19 other high school girls learned software programming, public speaking, product development and other skills to prepare them for jobs in the technology industry.\n\nGirls Who Code is among the recent crop of programs intended to close the gender gap in tech by intervening early, when young women are deciding what they want to study. With names like Hackbright Academy, Girl Develop It, Black Girls Code and Girls Teaching Girls to Code, these groups try to present a more exciting image of computer science.\n\nThe paucity of women in the tech industry has been well documented. Even though women represent more than half the overall work force, they hold less than a quarter of computing and technical jobs, according to the National Center for Women and Information Technology based at the University of Colorado, Boulder. At the executive and founder levels, women are even scarcer.\n\nA variety of advocacy and networking groups have tried to address the problem by coaching women on building start-ups, raising venture capital and climbing the management ranks at big companies. Most recently, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, published a best-selling book, “Lean In,” that was a call to arms for women to pursue their ambition in the workplace.\n\nEven so, the number of women entering technology has been declining. Women earn just 12 percent of computer science degrees, down from 37 percent in 1984. Tech executives, recruiters and financiers say women simply do not walk through their doors seeking work.\n\n“We actively recruit women, but there’s just not that many women who want to do this kind of work and are equipped to do the work from their education,” said Adam Messinger, the chief technology officer at Twitter, who is on the board of Girls Who Code.\n\nSo the industry is trying a new approach. It is tackling the problem long before women start their careers, by teaching girls the basic skill of writing code.\n\n“We have to get women on the right side of the computer,” said Margit Wennmachers, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. Knowing a programming language is becoming essential not just for engineers, she added, but also for women who want to be tech executives or deal-makers or pursue other careers, from medicine to fashion.\n\n“The dividing line is learning to code,” Ms. Wennmachers said. “You either tell the computer what to do and you’ve got lots of great career options. Or the computer tells you what to do and you end up working in a shoe store.”\n\nGroups like Girls Who Code are part of a national movement to recruit young people to software development and remain competitive with other economies. A new group, code.org, for example, has people like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Bill Gates of Microsoft pushing for all schools to teach children to code.\n\nBut the need is most urgent for girls, said Reshma Saujani, who founded Girls Who Code last year. Roughly 74 percent of girls in middle school express an interest in engineering, science and math, she said. But by the time they get to college, just 0.3 percent choose computer science as a major.\n\nMs. Saujani, the daughter of two engineers who were refugees from Uganda, developed the idea while she was running for Congress, a race that she lost. As she traveled from school to school on the campaign trail, she said she saw the same thing over and over: computer science classrooms without a single girl.\n\n“I saw the ability of technology to either enhance poverty or reduce it, and I saw girls not getting the same opportunities boys were,” said Ms. Saujani, who is now campaigning for public advocate in New York City. “Back in the ’60s, you didn’t have gender parity in law or medicine, but something happened and women started opting into these professions. We have to do that in computer science.”\n\nResearchers say many factors contribute to girls’ reluctance to pursue computing as early as elementary school, including discouraging parents, inadequate resources for teachers and a lack of exposure. Studies have shown that girls imagine computer scientists as men working alone in a basement and can’t relate.\n\nIt’s a significant disconnect, given how women embrace technology. Female consumers make up a majority of users for many tech products. For technology companies, women also offer a diverse perspective, which can help bolster the bottom line."

(a) No application for a permit to carry a handgun shall be approved by a police chief of a municipality, the Superintendent or the Superior Court, unless the applicant: 1. Is a person of good character who is not subject to any of the disabilities ... as provided in this chapter;\n\n2. Has demonstrated that at the time of the application for the permit he or she is thoroughly familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns; and\n\n3. Has demonstrated a justifiable need to carry a handgun. (italics added)\n\nPlaintiff/applicants say the case presents two Second Amendment issues: (1) Is there a constitutional right to carry a handgun outside one's home for self-defense? (2) Can the state of New Jersey require those who seek a permit to carry a handgun to prove a justifiable need?\n\nPlaintiffs argue that because New Jersey carry permits must be renewed every two years and officials grant only about 1200 carry permits in that two-year period, the law is tantamount to no public carry rights at all.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyer is Alan Gura, a well-known Second Amendment specialist who successfully argued the Heller and McDonald cases at the Supreme Court. Gura has been quoted in the New Jersey Herald as saying, \"Drake is about a state thumbing its nose at Supreme Court decisions that said the Second Amendment is about carrying in case of confrontation.” He added: “This is about the Supreme Court enforcing what they have already pronounced.”\n\nI respect Mr. Gura's arguments in the courtroom, but that statement to a reporter is hyperbole. In the Heller and McDonald cases, the Supreme Court explicitly limited its rulings to a handgun for self-defense in one's home, and that has been the settled law for almost six years. And New Jersey's judges and public officials have shown no disrespect at all for the US Supreme Court in their rulings against Drake and the other applicants.\n\nThe Issue and Argument of Defendants. New Jersey allows public carry, albeit that it severely restricts it. It contends only the second question is before the Court - the justifiable need aspect - and that is a question settled by New Jersey's long-standing policy to restrict for public safety reasons public carry of firearms in civilian hands.\n\nAs the Third Circuit Court of Appeals stated:\n\n\n\nIt is New Jersey’s judgment that when an individual carries a handgun in public for his or her own defense, he or she necessarily exposes members of the community to a somewhat heightened risk that they will be injured by that handgun. New Jersey has decided that this somewhat heightened risk to the public may be outweighed by the potential safety benefit to an individual with a “justifiable need” to carry a handgun. Furthermore, New Jersey has decided that it can best determine when the individual benefit outweighs the increased risk to the community through careful case-by-case scrutiny of each application, by the police and a court.\n\nThe opinions of the District Court and Court of Appeals can be found as appendices to Drake's Petition for Certiorari\n\nThe NRA's View. In its amicus filing, the NRA claims the first question totally resolves the case - that carry being a constitutional right, the state can't require any showing of need. Such an absolutist view would go farther even than the Heller case where the Supreme Court allowed room for a host of \"presumptively lawful regulatory measures.\"\n\nDrake's Petition for Certiorari. This is a request to bring the record from the court below to SCOTUS. \"Cert\" is granted if four of the nine Supreme Court justices vote for it in conference. If granted, briefs would be filed on the merits over the next several months and oral arguments would be scheduled for next fall.\n\nMore than 8000 cert requests are made during each nine month term but the Court grants argument for only about 80 cases. With only the rarest exceptions, no justice publicly discusses why the Court did or didn't choose to hear a case.\n\nWhat considerations bear on granting cert? Typically, the most compelling is that lower Federal courts (and perhaps state courts, too) are divided, as they certainly are on the carry issue. Nevertheless, SCOTUS declined to take three cases on public carry within the last year: (1) Kachalsky v. Cacace challenging New York's \"proper cause\" standard. (2) Woollard v. Gallagher, a challenge to Maryland's permit law that requires a \"good and substantial reason\"; and (3) NRA v. McCraw from Texas, which also raised the issue whether the state could properly bar 18-20 year olds from buying a gun.\n\nThe argument against \"May Issue\" in Kachalsky and Woollard, as it is in Drake, was that the strict administration of the requirement for cause is equivalent to granting virtually no permits at all. There are other issues as well - how demanding the standard should be for judging \"May Issue\" laws, for example - but the threshold question is whether there is a Second Amendment right to carry in the first place.\n\nOther Cases Coming. Is SCOTUS's past pattern of not accepting carry cases necessarily a prologue? Other carry cases are coming through the Federal court pipeline. Possibly these have a bearing on what - and when - the Supreme Court will act on Drake.\n\nNext to come for review is likely to be Peruta v. County of San Diego. California law allows each city and county to interpret the state's \"good cause\" standard for issuing concealed carry permits as it chooses. San Diego County took a restrictive approach, requiring elaborate documentation and the showing of \"a set of circumstances that distinguish the applicant from the mainstream and causes him or her to be placed in harm's way.\" Edward Peruta (who lives in California part of the year) and several other applicants could not show any specific threats against them. The County sheriff concluded they did not qualify for carry permits.\n\nThe Federal District Court held in Peruta that Heller does not stand for the broad proposition that all concealed weapon bans are presumptively constitutional. The next question, as it is in cases where the constitutionality of a statute is at issue, is the level of scrutiny to apply - how strict are the standards a court should use to decide if the statute complies with the constitution. SCOTUS explicitly left this undecided in Heller.)\n\nThe District Court applied intermediate scrutiny, finding that the County's policy favoring public safety and reducing the rate of gun use in crime was \"reasonably related to a 'significant,' 'substantial,' or 'important' governmental interest. Moreover:\n\n\n\nThe government also has an important interest in reducing the number of concealed handguns in public because of their disproportionate involvement in life-threatening crimes of violence, particularly in streets and other public places.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit reversed, holding (2-1) that to \"bear arms\" meant to carry them and that SCOTUS's Heller decision pointed in favor of allowing carry for the purpose of confrontational self-defense. The Court declared that a constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in public was so strong that the County's application of \"good cause\" was too restrictive no matter what level of scrutiny applied.\n\nThe decision was by a three panel, as is the case with almost all Federal appellate court\n\ndecisions. However, a losing party can ask the full court to hear the case en banc. (The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has 45 judges, 16 of whom have senior status and a reduced workload, if any, so 29 are available. I understand the practice in the Ninth Circuit to be that it 11 judges would hear an en banc reargument, although it rarely grants one.)\n\nMatters got complicated when San Diego County announced it would not appeal and planned to start issuing carry permits when the decision became final. That prompted California Attorney General Kamala Harris to petition for en banc review. The State of California had not been a party to the case, so it asked to intervene as did the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and - jointly - the California Police Chiefs Association and the California Peace Officers Association.\n\nAs of May 2, the requests to intervene and for en banc reconsideration remain pending. It took three years (!) for the Peruta case to get from the US District Court's decision to that three-judge Ninth Circuit decision. There is no particular reason to think the Ninth Circuit will act swiftly.\n\nObservations. An interesting facet of Drake's case is that unlike most states, New Jersey statutes do not seem to distinguish between carrying a firearm openly or concealed. Attorney Gura argues that this makes his case a better one for SCOTUS to decide:\n\n\n\nNor does it involve any difficult questions as to time, place or manner restrictions on the carrying of handguns. Because New Jersey’s law operates without distinction between the concealed and open carrying of handguns, confusing questions as to the manner in which Petitioners might exercise their rights are avoided.\n\nWhether Drake is a purer, less confusing case is debatable. NJ courts have discretion to impose the types of conditions that the applicants argue are not present in this case.\n\nSo, John Drake's case is in waiting. Speculation abounds on why it was relisted for a third time.\n\nAfter all, this current Supreme Court seems quite willing to accept controversial issues. Are some justices deterred by the strong presence of diverse \"states' rights\" policies on firearms matters? Even after almost six years since Heller, is SCOTUS still reluctant to enter into its next Second Amendment ruling? Are the justices awaiting another case, possibly Peruta? Is one of the majority justices in Heller waffling, making the others worried about the outcome of the next gun rights case?\n\nAll this, of course, is completely speculative.

         "A new report identifies 12 \"epicenters\" worldwide where changing climate could spark conflict\n\nThe national security establishment needs to prepare for a series of global crises sparked by climate change, a group of experts wrote in a report released today. The analysis by the Center for Climate and Security identifies 12 “epicenters” where climate change could stress global security, possibly igniting conflicts around the world. American diplomats and military planners have already started grappling with some of these problems—but the links between them do not get enough attention, the experts said. And it is an open question whether the Trump administration confronts those challenges or tries to ignore them.\n\nI think we all know the answer to that last question.\n\nHere are the 12 epicenters:\n\n1. Eroding Sovereignty: Climate change will make it harder for governments to provide basic necessities, increasing the likelihood of unrest.\n\n2. Water Towers: Billions of people are dependent on “water towers” — mountains covered with snow and ice that melts, feeding streams and rivers below. As that water grows scarce, tensions will rise.\n\n3. Atlantis 2.0: Low-lying islands like the Maldives may disappear altogether, creating a refugee crisis.\n\n4. Dire Straits: Maritime trade routes will be stressed by the change in patterns of trade that climate change will create, as well as more directly. The Panama Canal, for example, uses fresh water to move ships through its locks (54 million gallons for each ship).\n\n5. Nuclear & Climate: Climate change will increase nuclear risk.\n\n6. Health Security: Climate change may increase global pandemics.\n\n7. Coastal Megacities: The rapidly growing coastal cities of the world may be flooded by rising sea levels, destabilizing nations.\n\n8. Water Weaponization: Terrorists are already using water as a weapon; climate change is likely to make it worse.\n\n9. A Melting Arctic: Vanishing ice will make the Arctic more accessible, increasing the likelihood of conflict over its resources.\n\n10. Fish and Conflict: A warming ocean will increase conflicts over fish stocks.\n\n11. Coffee Conflict: Global trade networks that millions of people depend on will be disrupted.\n\n12. Migration and Displacement: Climate change is a significant and growing driver of migration and displacement.\n\n“The humanitarian effects of [climate change] are massive,” he said. “But what we’re saying is that those humanitarian consequences are likely to spill over into broader security problems that speaks to the heart of how the world organizes itself.”\n\nThe report is here:\n\nEpicenters of Climate and Security: The New Geostrategic Landscape of the Anthropocene [134 page PDF]\n\nAnd there’s an introductory video here:"

         "\n\"We say to our Republicans who want to privatize Medicare, we say: go try it. Make our day,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer said. | Getty Schumer accuses GOP of 'war on seniors' Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nFuture Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer trotted out a new messaging attack on Donald Trump and congressional Republicans on Tuesday, accusing the GOP of \"plotting a war on seniors\" with its plans to repeal Obamacare and potentially privatize Medicare. \nFaced with having to swallow Rep. Tom Price's (R-Ga.) nomination as Trump's secretary of health and human services, Schumer is hoping that unified Democratic opposition to privatizing health care plans for seniors can be a rallying point — as well as a political shield to save endangered Democratic senators. Senate Democrats are defending five Senate seats in deeply conservative states in 2018, but Schumer vowed that his entire caucus will oppose any effort to change the current single-payer Medicare system for seniors. Story Continued Below \n\"Between this nomination of an avowed Medicare opponent and the Republicans here threatening to privatize Medicare it's clear that Washington Republicans are plotting a war on seniors next year. Every senior, every American, should hear this loudly and clearly: Democrats will not let them win that fight,\" Schumer said. \"Democrats from blue states, purple states, red states are going to link arm-and-arm to protect Medicare for our seniors and ensure that Republicans don't succeed in putting our seniors healthcare at risk.\" \nA bid to make changes to entitlement programs is most likely to start in the House, where House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has suggested that a repeal of Obamacare should be paired with changes to programs like Medicare. Price has likewise listed Medicare reform as a key priority for Republicans. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to address the matter on Tuesday and Trump has not voiced support for changing Medicare to a private insurance program. \nGiven the lack of GOP unity on the issue, along with the voting strength of seniors, Medicare offers Schumer an opportunity to go on the offensive after Democrats were crushed on Election Day. And while Democrats retain the power to filibuster legislation in the Senate, Republicans could conceivably force through entitlement reforms via budget reconciliation, which allows passage of some legislation by a simple majority. \nBut that would be far more difficult if Schumer and congressional Democrats are able to mount a sustained campaign against the GOP's \"war on seniors,\" a strategy reminiscent of their \"war on women\" messaging of past election cycles as well as the party's opposition to President George W. Bush's efforts to privatize Social Security. \n\"Just as their efforts failed then, they will fail now. We say to our Republicans who want to privatize Medicare, we say: go try it. Make our day,\" Schumer said. "

         "Why We Oppose Planned Parent Hood ( The following is a reprint of the STOPP's essay \"Why We Oppose Planned Parenthood\") Planned Parenthood is not a benevolent organization trying to strengthen women's rights. It is a cold, calculating group intent on spreading the Humanist religion, luring our children into their web of premarital sex and unlimited abortions, reducing the population of minorities in particula and filling its coffers with the profits from sales of birth control devices. PP COMES BETWEEN PARENTS & CHILDREN\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood pushes what it calls “confidential services” for minors, meaning that PP will provide all types of “reproductive services” to young girls, including potentially dangerous prescription medication and invasive surgery, without their parents’ knowledge. In its 1993-1994 Annual Report, PP bragged of its “unswerving commitment to confidentiality.”\n\n\n\nIn most states, PP assigns teens a “code name” so that PP can call the girls at home and pretend to be a girlfriend. (Recently, the code names in Springfield, IL; Chicago, IL; and Kingston, NY; were Heather, Nancy and Lucy, respectively.)\n\n\n\nAs long ago as 1979, the Sunday Independent newspaper in Wilkes-Barre, PA, reported that Planned Parenthood was transporting high school girls out of town, during school hours, to get abortions without the parents being notified.\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood will give minor girls Norplant, Depo-Provera shots, and even abortions without their parents’ knowledge.\n\n\n\nPP DOES NOT OPPOSE TEENAGE SEX\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood does not view teenage sex as wrong. PP is upset only if sex results in “unwanted” births. Planned Parenthood’s sex education programs are not about telling children how to avoid sex. They are, rather, designed to indoctrinate our children into what PP calls “responsible sexuality.” By this PP means it is okay for kids to have sex as long as they avoid pregnancy; or if they do get pregnant, have an abortion.\n\n\n\nFormer PP president Faye Wattleton confirmed this in the Los Angeles Times, on October 17, 1986: “[Planned Parenthood is] not going to be an organization promoting celibacy or chastity.”\n\n\n\nThe current PP president, Pamela Maraldo, in an article in the March/April 1993 issue of Family Planning World, condemned abstinence-only sex ed programs as “unacceptable.” She endorsed, instead, the position of former United States Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who said, “We’ve taught our children in driver’s education what to do in the front seat, and now we’ve got to teach them what to do in the back seat.”\n\n\n\nPP SPREADS RELIGION OF HUMANISM\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood is dedicated to spreading the religious doctrine of Humanism as defined in the Humanist Manifestos (I & II).\n\n\n\nPP has consistently refused to give our children a clear message of “right” and “wrong.” It seeks not to educate our children in moral values, but to indoctrinate them into the Humanist philosophy that proclaims there is no objective moral code, and that right and wrong can be decided solely by the individual.\n\n\n\nIn the Los Angeles Times article quoted above, Faye Wattleton said, “[Planned Parenthood’s] concern is not to convey ‘shoulds’ or ‘should nots.’”\n\n\n\nFearing that moral people on school boards may lead to schools teaching our young children right from wrong, Pamela Maraldo said, in the article referred to above, “...we must bring an immediate halt to the aggressive infiltration of local school boards by the religious right.”\n\n\n\nAny school program endorsed by Planned Parenthood will give children complete information on how to have sex. The children will be given no moral guidance in a PP program and will be told they can do it or not do it depending on how they feel. While this concept of no absolute rights or wrongs may be embraced by some people in the world, it is rejected by most. Most people subscribe to religious principles that recognize a supreme authority over life and a set of divinely inspired principles on which our behavior must be conditioned. Parents who support STOPP are among this latter group and, therefore, oppose all PP programs for teens.\n\n\n\nPP POSES A DANGER TO WOMEN\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood runs a business providing birth control devices to its customers. Although PP is officially a non-profit organization, IRS regulations allow it to make profits on parts of its operation. PP does make a profit on its sale of birth control devices and seems to operate more to protect that income than its clients.\n\n\n\nA primary example of this is their provision of birth control pills. The Pill has long been a major income producer for PP.\n\n\n\nAt the Third Annual AIDS Conference in Washington in June 1987, Dr. Frank Plummer of the Kenya Medical Institute reported that oral contraceptive users appear to be less resistant to AIDS than non-users. Still PP refused to get teenage girls and others off the Pill.\n\n\n\nThen, Family Planning Perspectives (Vol. 25, No. 6, p. 243) reported: “Women who are seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and use the pill are more likely than nonusers to have HIV present in their cervical secretions, and may be more likely to infect their sexual partners.” The AGI story goes on to say: “The presence of HIV in cervical secretions was nearly 12 times as likely among pill users as among non-users.”\n\n\n\nStill, PP refused to tell its customers to get off the Pill to reduce the risk of AIDS. If PP were really concerned about women, it would stop selling the Pill. However, this would mean about an $85,000,000 decrease in PP income.\n\n\n\nThis same disregard for women can also be seen in Planned Parenthood’s handling of the Norplant problem. In 1993 and 1994, numerous lawsuits were filed by Norplant users over the side effects of the implants and the difficulty of removal. Yet PP not only continues to make this device available, it still implants it in minors without parental knowledge. Continue to page 2"

         "San Francisco, California (EFF) ­—The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the ACLU Foundation of Southern California (ACLU SoCal) are urging California’s highest court to rule that license plate data, collected indiscriminately on millions of drivers by police across the state, are not investigative records and should be made available to the public.\n\nEFF and ACLU SoCal argued in a brief filed today with the California Supreme Court that citizens needs access to automated license plate reader (ALPR) records to understand exactly how this intrusive technology is used.\n\nALPRs are high-speed cameras mounted on light poles and police cars that continuously scan the plates of every passing car. They collect not only the license plate number but also the time, date, and location of each plate scanned, along with a photograph of the vehicle and sometimes its occupants. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD) collect, on average, three million plate scans every week and have amassed a database of half a billion records.\n\nEFF filed public records requests for a week’s worth of ALPR data from the agencies and, along with ACLU SoCal, sued after both refused to release the records.\n\nEFF and ACLU SoCal are now asking the state supreme court to overturn aruling in the case from a lower court that said all license plate data—collected indiscriminately and without suspicion that the vehicle or driver was involved in a crime—could be withheld from disclosure as “records of law enforcement investigations.”\n\n“That argument is tantamount to saying all drivers in Los Angeles are under criminal investigation at all times,’’ said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Jennifer Lynch. “The ruling sets a troubling standard that would not just allow these agencies to keep ALPR data from the public but could also allow the police to keep data and footage from other surveillance technologies—from body cameras to drones to face recognition—from ever being scrutinized.”\n\n“Drivers would be surprised to learn that they are under investigation every time they drive in public,” said Peter Bibring, director of police practices at the ACLU SoCal. “The Fourth Amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution exactly to prevent law enforcement from conducting mass, suspicionless investigations under ‘general warrants’ that target no specific person or place and never expire.”"

         "The announcement July 30 that the U.S. economy grew at a four-percent annual rate for the second quarter of 2014 has financial analysts wondering if the Federal Reserve Bank will end earlier than expected the “quantitative easing” and interest rate suppression it has engaged in since 2008.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), “Real gross domestic product — the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States — increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent in the second quarter of 2014.... In the first quarter, real GDP decreased 2.1 percent (revised).” The numbers for the first quarter were better than previously announced, as the revised estimate replaced a 2.9 percent decrease in GDP.\n\nThe BEA noted that much of the growth can be attributed to a change in business inventory rather than actual market sales:\n\nThe change in real private inventories added 1.66 percentage points to the second-quarter change in real GDP after subtracting 1.16 percentage points from the first-quarter change. Private businesses increased inventories $$93.4 billion in the second quarter, following increases of $$35.2 billion in the first quarter and $$81.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.\n\nHowever, another part of the reason for economic “growth” was the increase in spending by the government sector, including state and local governments, with a 3.1-percent increase during the second quarter after several years of budget cuts.\n\nThe BEA also announced multi-year revisions to its economic growth projections, claiming that new analysis showed lower-than-announced growth had occurred in 2011 and 2012, but higher-than-announced growth had occurred in 2013. Reuters reported,\n\nThe government raised 2013 third-quarter growth to a 4.5 percent annual pace from the previous 4.1 percent. Growth for the fourth quarter of last year was lifted to a 3.5 percent annual rate from a previously reported 2.6 percent. Growth for 2013 was raised to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent.\n\nThe lackluster recovery — an average of just over two percent real GDP growth since 2010, as compared to more than four percent annually for seven years after the 1981-82 recession — is largely a result of a much lower national savings rate (about half of the 1982 level), and to a lesser extent higher government debt load (more than double the 1982 levels). But with the economy apparently heating up a little, the Wall Street Journal reported July 30,\n\nDebate at the Fed is now turning to when to start raising interest rates. When last surveyed in June, most Fed officials said they expected to wait until 2015 and to move gradually once rate increases begin.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank Open Market Committee officials — who have suppressed interest rates to zero since 2007 and have been creating money that is given to banks under the label “quantitative easing” (QE) since 2008 — had previously announced they will create progressively lower quantities of money each month, but have yet to announce an end date to new money creation.\n\nThe purchase of banks' financial assets (mortgages and student loans) on the open market by the Federal Reserve Bank with money created out of thin air is a direct transfer of wealth to the financial sector of the economy, in particular the largest banks and brokerage houses on Wall Street. Even at its current reduced rate of $$35 billion per month (it once stood at $$85 billion per month), QE is quite possibly the largest government corporate welfare scheme in human history.\n\nFor her part, Open Market Committee Chairman Janet Yellen has indicated that she doesn't believe the economy will heat up to four-percent annual GDP growth. “The Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation,” Yellen said July 30 in a written statement on the Federal Reserve Bank's website, “economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.”\n\nThat statement sounded to free market economists eerily like past economic prognostications of previous Fed chairmen. Yellen's predecessor Ben Bernanke told the media as late as July 2007 that “Overall, the U.S. economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007, with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy's underlying trend.” Of course, by that time the “Great Recession” had already begun.\n\nMany free market economists view the current economy as a bubble similar to the one of 2005-06, ready to pop once the Federal Reserve stops buying up mortgages and student loans in the open market under QE and lets interest rates rise.\n\nEuroPacific Capital President Peter Schiff told Yahoo Finance July 30 that the high growth rate in the second quarter had to be balanced against the contraction in the first quarter:\n\nThe bad news is it's all downhill from here.... I think that it's obvious that the stimulus is wearing off, that the euphoric effects of all the cheap money — even though the cheap money is still here — the effects are wearing off.\n\nAlthough Schiff added, “I think it's clear that the economy is rolling over,” he did not believe that Federal Reserve officials would do the right thing and let market forces take over.\n\nEstablishment financial analysts are less certain, and there's a fear of a new recession in an economy where the Federal Reserve cuts off of the economic “stimulus.” The London-based Financial Times warned July 30,\n\nAn outflow of deposits would be a reversal of a five-year trend that has seen significant amounts of extra cash poured into banks thanks to the Fed flooding the financial system with liquidity. These deposits, which act as a cheaper source of funding, have helped banks weather the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\nNow the worry is that such deposit funding may prove fleeting as the Fed retreats. Banks might have to pay higher rates on deposits to retain customers — potentially hitting their profits and sparking a price war for client funds.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's policy of suppressing interest rates has had a devastating impact on U.S. national savings rates — the largest factor in sustainable economic growth — by punishing savers with interest rates that often don't even equal the rate of inflation.\n\nBut despite “fears” of the corporate welfare gravy train ending on the part of Wall Street banking fat-cats, the Federal Reserve Bank has yet to announce a \"tapering\" of its $$35-billion-per-month transfer of money from the purchasing power of consumers to big banks.\n\nPhoto of Federal Reserve Headquarters in Washington, D.C."

         "Scientists move Doomsday Clock ahead by 30 seconds, closest to apocalypse since 1953 – “As of today, it is two minutes to midnight”\n\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\n\nDesdemona Despair\n\nBy Lindsey Bever, Sarah Kaplan, and Abby Ohlheiser\n\n25 January 2018 (The Washington Post) – Alexa, what time is the apocalypse? Ulp. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock a notch closer to the end of humanity Thursday, moving it ahead by 30 seconds after what the organization called a “grim assessment” of the state of geopolitical affairs. “As of today,” Bulletin president Rachel Bronson told reporters, “it is two minutes to midnight.” In moving the clock 30 seconds closer to the hour of the apocalypse, the group cited “the failure of President Trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change.” The organization — whose board includes 15 Nobel Laureates — now believes “the world is not only more dangerous now than it was a year ago; it is as threatening as it has been since World War II,” Bulletin officials Lawrence M. Krauss and Robert Rosner wrote in an op-ed published Thursday by The Washington Post. “In fact, the Doomsday Clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953, when Cold War fears perhaps reached their highest levels.” Krauss, a theoretical physicist, and Rosner, an astrophysicist, added: “To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger — and its immediacy. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region and the United States.” The clock, a metaphorical measure of humankind’s proximity to global catastrophe, also advanced 30 seconds last year, to 2½ minutes to “midnight” — the closest to the apocalyptic hour it has been since 1953, after the United States tested its first thermonuclear device, followed months later by the Soviet Union’s hydrogen bomb test. Before Thursday’s announcement, experts said there was only one direction the clock could possibly move, given recent events — including North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile test and the my-nuclear-button-is-bigger-than-yours war of words between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “I think it would be very hard for the clock not​ to move forward,” Alex Wellerstein, who specializes in the history of nuclear weapons at the Stevens Institute of Technology, said in an email leading up to the announcement. “We have members of Congress, White House advisers, and even the president implying that they think war with a nuclear state is not only likely, but potentially desirable. That’s unusual and disturbing. “The question I have is: How much forward can they go?” Another 30 seconds, to be exact. [more]\n\nThe Doomsday Clock just moved: It’s now 2 minutes to ‘midnight,’ the symbolic hour of the apocalypse\n\nBy Lawrence Krauss and Robert Rosner\n\n25 January 2018\n\n(The Washington Post) – Days after Donald Trump took the oath of office, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists reset the Doomsday Clock to 2½ minutes to midnight, in part because of destabilizing comments and threats from America’s new commander in chief. One year later, we are moving the clock forward again by 30 seconds, due to the failure of President Trump and other world leaders to deal with looming threats of nuclear war and climate change. The Science and Security Board for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists assesses that the world is not only more dangerous now than it was a year ago; it is as threatening as it has been since World War II. In fact, the Doomsday Clock is as close to midnight today as it was in 1953, when Cold War fears perhaps reached their highest levels. To call the world nuclear situation dire is to understate the danger — and its immediacy. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region and the United States. The failure in 2017 to secure a temporary freeze on North Korea’s nuclear development was unsurprising to observers of the downward spiral of nuclear rhetoric between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But North Korea’s developing nuclear program will reverberate not just in the Asia-Pacific, as neighboring countries review their security options, but more widely, as all countries consider the costs and benefits of the international framework of nonproliferation treaties and agreements. Global nuclear risks were compounded by U.S.-Russia relations that now feature more conflict than cooperation. The United States and Russia remained at odds, continuing military exercises along the borders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, undermining the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, upgrading their nuclear arsenals and eschewing arms control negotiations. Tensions over the South China Sea have increased. Pakistan and India have continued to build ever-larger arsenals of nuclear weapons. And in the Middle East, uncertainty about continued U.S. support for the landmark Iranian nuclear deal adds to a bleak overall picture. A related danger is the rise of cyberthreats targeting national infrastructure, including power grids, water supplies and military systems. On the climate-change front, the danger may seem less immediate than risk of nuclear annihilation, but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now. Global carbon dioxide emissions have not yet shown the beginnings of the sustained decline toward zero that must occur if we are to avoid ever-greater warming. The nations of the world will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse-gas emissions to manage even the climate risk accepted in the Paris accord. So far, the global response has fallen far short of meeting this challenge. The Trump administration’s decision essentially to turn a blind eye to climate change transpired against a backdrop of a worsening climate, including exceedingly powerful hurricanes in the Caribbean and other parts of North America and extreme heat waves in Australia, South America, Asia, Europe and California. The Arctic ice cap achieved its smallest-ever winter maximum in 2017. And last week, data from 2017 demonstrated a continued trend of exceptional global warmth. We believe that the perilous world security situation described here would, in itself, justify moving the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight. But there also is a real threat posed by a fundamental breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent U.S. actions. In 2017, the United States backed away from its long-standing leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges. Neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict U.S. actions or discern between sincere U.S. pronouncements and mere rhetoric. U.S. allies have needed reassurance about American intentions more than ever. Instead, they have been force to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from an administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals and suffering from turnover in senior leadership. Led by an undisciplined and disruptive president, the administration has failed to develop, coordinate and clearly communicate a coherent nuclear policy. This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management and global stability. We hope this resetting of the clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant: an urgent warning of global danger. The time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the continuing march of climate change is long past. The time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now. It is time to rewind the Doomsday Clock.\n\nWe’re as close to Doomsday today as we were during the Cold War\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C., 25 January 2018 (Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists) – Citing growing nuclear risks and unchecked climate dangers, the iconic Doomsday Clock is now 30 seconds closer to midnight, the closest to the symbolic point of annihilation that the Clock has been since 1953 at the height of the Cold War. The decision announced today to move the Doomsday Clock to two minutes before midnight was made by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board in consultation with the Board of Sponsors, which includes 15 Nobel Laureates. The full text of the Doomsday Clock statement is available at http://www.thebulletin.org and includes key recommendations about how to #RewindtheDoomsdayClock.\n\nVideo from the Doomsday Clock announcement at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., is available at http://clock.thebulletin.org/ and on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/BulletinOfTheAtomicScientists/. The statement explaining the resetting of the time of the Doomsday Clock notes: “In 2017, world leaders failed to respond effectively to the looming threats of nuclear war and climate change, making the world security situation more dangerous than it was a year ago—and as dangerous as it has been since World War II. The greatest risks last year arose in the nuclear realm. North Korea’s nuclear weapons program appeared to make remarkable progress in 2017, increasing risks for itself, other countries in the region, and the United States. Hyperbolic rhetoric and provocative actions on both sides have increased the possibility of nuclear war by accident or miscalculation …. On the climate change front, the danger may seem less immediate, but avoiding catastrophic temperature increases in the long run requires urgent attention now …. The nations of the world will have to significantly decrease their greenhouse gas emissions to keep climate risks manageable, and so far, the global response has fallen far short of meeting this challenge.” Fueling concerns about the potential of a nuclear holocaust are a range of U.S.-Russian military entanglements, South China Sea tensions, escalating rhetoric between Pakistan and India, and uncertainty about continued U.S. support for the Iran nuclear deal. Contributing to the risks of nuclear and non-nuclear clashes around the globe are the rise of nation-state information technology and internet-based campaigns attacking infrastructure and free elections, according to the statement. Also highlighted as an overarching global concern: The decline of U.S. leadership and a related demise of diplomacy under the Trump Administration. “… [T]here has also been a breakdown in the international order that has been dangerously exacerbated by recent U.S. actions. In 2017, the United States backed away from its longstanding leadership role in the world, reducing its commitment to seek common ground and undermining the overall effort toward solving pressing global governance challenges. Neither allies nor adversaries have been able to reliably predict U.S. actions or understand when U.S. pronouncements are real, and when they are mere rhetoric. International diplomacy has been reduced to name-calling, giving it a surrealistic sense of unreality that makes the world security situation ever more threatening.” In January 2017, the Doomsday Clock’s minute hand edged forward by 30 seconds, to two and half minutes before midnight. For the first time, the Doomsday Clock was influenced by statements from an incoming U.S. President, Donald Trump, regarding the proliferation and the prospect of actually using nuclear weapons, as well as statements made in opposition to U.S. commitments regarding climate change. Rachel Bronson, president and CEO, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, said: “Because of the extraordinary danger of the current moment, the Science and Security Board today moves the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock 30 seconds closer to catastrophe. It is now two minutes to midnight­­­­—the closest the Clock has ever been to Doomsday, and as close as it was in 1953, at the height of the Cold War.” Lawrence Krauss, director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University, Foundation Professor at School of Earth and Space Exploration and Physics Department, Arizona State University, and chair, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Board of Sponsors, said: “The current, extremely dangerous state of world affairs need not be permanent. The means for managing dangerous technology and reducing global-scale risk exist; indeed, many of them are well-known and within society’s reach, if leaders pay reasonable attention to preserving the long-term prospects of humanity, and if citizens demand that they do so. This is a dangerous time, but the danger is of our own making. Humankind has invented the implements of apocalypse; so can it invent the methods of controlling and eventually eliminating them. This year, leaders and citizens of the world can move the Doomsday Clock and the world away from the metaphorical midnight of global catastrophe by taking common-sense action.” Robert Rosner, William E. Wrather Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and Physics at the University of Chicago, and chair, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “We hope this resetting of the Clock will be interpreted exactly as it is meant—as an urgent warning of global danger. The time for world leaders to address looming nuclear danger and the continuing march of climate change is long past. The time for the citizens of the world to demand such action is now: #RewindtheDoomsdayClock.” Sharon Squassoni, research professor of practice at the Institute for International Science and Technology Policy, Elliott School of International Affairs, The George Washington University, and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “In the past year, U.S. allies have needed reassurance about American intentions more than ever. Instead, they have been forced to negotiate a thicket of conflicting policy statements from a U.S. administration weakened in its cadre of foreign policy professionals, suffering from turnover in senior leadership, led by an undisciplined and disruptive president, and unable to develop, coordinate, and clearly communicate a coherent nuclear policy. This inconsistency constitutes a major challenge for deterrence, alliance management, and global stability. It has made the existing nuclear risks greater than necessary and added to their complexity.” Sivan Kartha, senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute and co-leader of SEI’s Gender and Social Equity Program, and Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board, said: “2017 just clocked in as the hottest year on record that wasn’t boosted by an El Nino. And that matches what we’ve witnessed on the ground: the Caribbean suffered a season of historic damage from exceedingly powerful hurricanes, extreme heat waves struck across the globe, the Arctic ice cap hit its lowest winter peak on record, and the U.S. suffered devastating wildfires. And while this was happening, the Trump administration dutifully carried through on the campaign promise of derailing U.S. climate policy, putting avowed climate denialists in top cabinet positions, and announcing plans to withdraw from the Paris climate Agreement. Thankfully, this didn’t cause global cooperation to unravel, and other countries have reaffirmed their commitment to take action against climate change.” #RewindtheDoomsdayClock is a major message of the 2018 statement, with the following action steps among those recommended: U.S. President Donald Trump should refrain from provocative rhetoric regarding North Korea, recognizing the impossibility of predicting North Korean reactions. The U.S. and North Korean governments should open multiple channels of communication.\n\nThe world community should pursue, as a short-term goal, the cessation of North Korea’s nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests. North Korea is the only country to violate the norm against nuclear testing in 20 years.\n\nThe Trump administration should abide by the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for Iran’s nuclear program unless credible evidence emerges that Iran is not complying with the agreement or Iran agrees to an alternative approach that meets U.S. national security needs.\n\nThe United States and Russia should discuss and adopt measures to prevent peacetime military incidents along the borders of NATO.\n\nU.S. and Russian leaders should return to the negotiating table to resolve differences over the INF treaty, to seek further reductions in nuclear arms, to discuss a lowering of the alert status of the nuclear arsenals of both countries, to limit nuclear modernization programs that threaten to create a new nuclear arms race, and to ensure that new tactical or low-yield nuclear weapons are not built, and existing tactical weapons are never used on the battlefield.\n\nU.S. citizens should demand, in all legal ways, climate action from their government. Climate change is a real and serious threat to humanity.\n\nGovernments around the world should redouble their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so they go well beyond the initial, inadequate pledges under the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe international community should establish new protocols to discourage and penalize the misuse of information technology to undermine public trust in political institutions, in the media, in science, and in the existence of objective reality itself.

Thirty-eight percent supported armed struggle, up from just 21% in the previous survey. A similar but less extreme trend was seen among Israeli Jews. Thirty-eight percent said a peace deal should be sought, down from 45% six months ago, and the percentage of supporters for a “decisive military offensive” to end the conflict increased from 12% to 19%.\n\nAll experts point to Trump’s Jerusalem declaration as the reason calls for violence have risen.\n\nCalls for violence among Palestinian groups is nothing new, however.

         "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said Friday his state would give up all federal education funding in order to avoid complying with the gender equity law Title IX in how trans students are treated. www.huffingtonpost.com/...\n\nWhat is Title IX\n\n1. Title IX is a landmark federal civil right that prohibits sex discrimination in education. Title IX is not just about sports; it is a prohibition against sex-based discrimination in education. It addresses discrimination against pregnant and parenting students and women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs. It also addresses sexual harassment, gender-based discrimination, and sexual violence. Sexual violence includes attempted or completed rape or sexual assault, as well as sexual harassment, stalking, voyeurism, exhibitionism, verbal or physical sexuality-based threats or abuse, and intimate partner violence. 2. Title IX does not apply to female students only. Title IX protects any person from sex-based discrimination, regardless of their real or perceived sex, gender identity, and/or gender expression. Female, male, and gender non-conforming students, faculty, and staff are protected from any sex-based discrimination, harassment or violence. 3. Your school must be proactive in ensuring that your campus is free of sex discrimination. You are protected under Title IX even if you do not experience sex discrimination directly. Schools must take immediate steps to address any sex discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual violence on campus to prevent it from affecting students further. If a school knows or reasonably should know about discrimination, harassment or violence that is creating a “hostile environment” for any student, it must act to eliminate it, remedy the harm caused and prevent its recurrence. knowyourix.org/...\n\nSo if All Texas College Football Teams are not letting Transgender students go to the bathroom of their own choice then can a college in compliance with title IX allow a home football game with a non Title IX compliant Texas Team and expect to keep their Federal Funding? Colleges must prevent ANY sex discrimination on campus even if its from the other team’s football team.\n\nGiven how popular football is in Texas imagine how many parents will be angry that their son’s Texas college football scholarship will not let their son’s play football against other state colleges theirby drastically effecting their son’s chances of making it to a Pro Football Team?\n\nNext imagine how many Texas football coaches will get angry that their best players are suddenly all taking offers to play football in out of state colleges because they want better odds of playing play pro ball?\n\nHow many colleges that make money off of their college football teams ( there are not that many but some ) will be looking at years to rebuild their championship college teams from scratch?\n\nAll it will take to get Texas to comply is for just a little more pressure to be applied and if that pressure is applied now this will help the Dems will the election. Showing strength wins Conservative votes not ideas and either Texas backs down before the election ( which helps us win the election ) or the fall Texas football season will be very disappointing.\n\nGiven Trump is expected to lose no matter who he runs against Texas Parents and Colleges will then have 4 years to change Texas Blue or at the very least change Texas’s bathroom policy. The Texas GOP needs this issue to go away now and quietly before the election assuming that the White House has the Stones to go forward and avoid compromise."

         "GATES HEADS TO ASIA TO SHORE UP US POSITIONS\n\nUS Defense Secretary Robert Gates left for Asia this week to attend an annual security conference in Singapore to be held on Friday through Saturday at the level of regional defense ministers.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Robert Gates left for Asia this week to attend an annual security conference in Singapore to be held on Friday through Saturday at the level of regional defense ministers.\n\nThe annual security conference in Singapore, called the Shangri-la Dialogue, which gets its name from the Shangri-la Hotel in the city where the meeting is held, will bring top officials and experts from across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIn past years the events have been dominated by US concerns over China’s perceived military buildup. But this year, the death toll of tens of thousands of people in an earthquake in China and a cyclone in Myanmar are likely to highlight the need for greater regional cooperation.\n\nWhile US doubts about China’s intentions have not diminished, the US Secretary of Defense has largely taken a more congenial approach toward Beijing than his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, who was viewed in the region as a hawk. Gates, for example, recently cautioned the US military against what he called “next-war-it is”, arguing that it is more likely to face irregular conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan than conventional wars with other “near peer” states like China or Russia.\n\nBut at the same time, the Pentagon chief has encouraged the US military to strengthen defense ties with regional powers like India and Indonesia as a hedge against China. Overall, US administration officials need to do an intricate balancing act on this matter. They need to be clear that Washington is conscious of perceived China’s military threat. But at the same time they need to avoid provoking a confrontation with China at a time when the US is tied up in Iraq and Afghanistan and China is trying to cope with the aftermath of its devastating earthquake.\n\nYet, senior US military officials have stressed repeatedly over the past year that China has not done enough to put to rest US concerns about its military modernization. An annual Pentagon report to Congress said China is developing the means to project military power and deny the US military access to the region, particularly in a putative conflict with Taiwan.\n\nBut according to Michael Green, who served as Asian affairs director at the National Security Council in the Bush administration until 2005, “the overall strategic picture with China is very mixed, as it is with a lot of countries – enormous economic interdependence but a level of strategic mistrust that won’t go away”. And yet there have been some positive developments in the region as well. Chinese President Hu Jintao met the head of Taiwan’s ruling party in Beijing this week in the highest-level contact since the two sides split in 1949. This historic meeting representing the two arch-enemies is widely viewed in the world as part of a dramatic easing of tensions between the two sides that is likely to see them resume a formal dialogue that has been suspended for over a decade."

         "This week the Liberal Democratic Party, which had ruled Japan for nearly its entire postwar history until it was swept from power three years ago, won a landslide victory. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister from 2006 to 2007, will get another chance.\n\nMr. Abe devoted a decent part of his campaign to criticism of the Bank of Japan, the country’s central bank. He wants the bank to pursue inflation, and to effectively print money until it gets it. At one point during the campaign he spoke of a 3 percent inflation target, although he seems to have cut that back to 2 percent.\n\nEither goal, if realized, would be a major change for the country. The inflation index used in calculations of gross domestic product is now 18 percent lower than it was at the end of 1994.\n\nOn Thursday, the central bank took a relatively small step in the direction favored by Mr. Abe. It decided to step up its asset purchases and seemed to leave open the possibility that it would adopt the inflation target at a later meeting. Mr. Abe praised the move.\n\nTo a significant extent, deflationary expectations are now baked into the Japanese economy. Tiny government bond yields have persisted for many years. Even though the nominal yields are small, the real (after inflation) yields have been respectable because there has been deflation, not inflation. And the competition has not been that great. The stock market has fluctuated, but it remains far below where it was when the Japanese bubble began to deflate in the early 1990s. Real estate losses from that bubble — do you remember when the gardens of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were supposed to be worth more than the entire state of California? — still have an impact on investor psychology.\n\nWestern economists, Mr. Bernanke among them, have long called for Japan to target inflation. Lately, some Chinese economists have been offering similar lectures. But until now, little has happened. The central bank has announced a goal of positive inflation of up to 1 percent, but it is not widely believed, and it has certainly not happened.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs it is, the limited quantitative easing efforts of the Japanese central bank have been viewed as temporary, and as not really changing anything. Whether the new promises of something more significant will be credible remains to be seen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“At this point, moving to a 2 percent target would not be such a giant step,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who has suggested inflation targeting in the United States as well as in Japan. “They have to pursue it vigorously until we have inflation expectations firmly higher. No one knows how much they would have to do to accomplish that.”\n\nThe Bank of Japan has in the past been hesitant to really try to establish that credibility, for at least two reasons. One is that there is fear that the Japanese government bond market would be disrupted. Another is that it could do severe damage to the central bank’s own balance sheet. It owns a lot of Japanese government bonds whose market value would fall. Conceivably, that could cause the bank to seek a recapitalization from the government, something that would be embarrassing, to say the least.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTo establish the credibility, the central bank would have to show a readiness to create credit at a rapid rate. It would probably also need to take steps to hold down the value of the yen, a move that would no doubt cause concern in the United States.\n\nIt is, however, very doable, as Switzerland has shown. When the euro zone debt crisis was at its worst, Switzerland became a safe haven for European investors worried that the euro might blow up. That drove up the value of the Swiss franc versus the euro and damaged Switzerland’s ability to compete. The Swiss government responded by announcing that the euro would not be allowed to fall below 1.2 Swiss francs. If necessary, the government would simply sell francs to meet any demand.\n\nThat has been necessary, and the Swiss have accumulated a huge portfolio of foreign currency. So, too, could the Japanese if they chose to announce that the dollar would henceforth be worth at least 100 yen, a level not seen since 2009.\n\nDoing so would instantly restore at least some competitiveness to Japanese industry, which has experienced something that would have seemed impossible only a few years ago: Japan has a trade deficit.\n\nBringing inflation to Japan could make the country’s debt load — now higher than that of any other major country — appear more manageable. One unfortunate result of deflation coupled with perennial recession is that a country’s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio rises even if no more money is borrowed. Measured in yen, the Japanese economy was larger when Mr. Abe left office in 2007 — two years before his party lost power — than it is now.\n\nA stronger recovery in the United States, not to mention avoiding a new Europe-wide downturn, would make it easier for Japan to begin to grow again. But even if that did happen, it would not solve all of Japan’s problems. The country has an aging, shrinking population. It needs more workers, but the Japanese attitude toward immigration makes Arizona look liberal by comparison.\n\nJapan’s economy has been adrift for so long that much of the world takes for granted that it cannot, or at least will not, ever be reformed. Such cynicism has a basis, but it is possible that circumstances have changed. Japanese who seemed content with the way things were now clearly want something different, even if they are not sure what, or how to get it.\n\nThree years ago, the Democratic Party of Japan won a landslide election, only to prove stumbling and incoherent when it tried to govern. Now the voters have turned back to the Liberal Democrats. Whether Mr. Abe will be more competent, and whether he will be able to effectively lead a party that still has competing factions, is far from clear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, investors are taking heart. Japanese stocks leapt on the news of the election results, while the yen weakened. For now, at least, there is reason to hope that something important was changed by this election."

         "Will hate-filled clowns like Reza Aslan and Justin Raimondo, and a thousand Islamic supremacists who wrote me on Twitter about this killing, now apologize for trying to frame me and Pamela Geller for this murder? Let’s just say I won’t be holding my breath. Their Goebbels-like Big Lie and manifest dishonesty, however, is clear for all the world to see.\n\nBe sure to register for our Jessica Mokdad Human Rights Conference on honor killings on April 29th in Dearborn, Michigan. Register here.\n\nPamela Geller asks trenchantly: “Where are the million hijabs against honor killings?” After all, we saw Shaima used in demonstrations against the fictional phenomenon of “Islamophobia,” but no Muslims speak out against what really happened here.\n\n“Records hint Iraqi woman’s death not a hate crime,” by Kristina Davis for the San Diego Union-Tribune, April 4 (thanks to all who sent this in):\n\nEL CAJON “” Search warrant records obtained Wednesday in the beating death of an Iraqi-American woman show a family in turmoil and cast doubt on the likelihood that her slaying was a hate crime. Shaima Alawadi, a 32-year-old mother of five, was apparently planning to divorce her husband and move to Texas when she was killed, a family member told investigators, according to the court documents. The records obtained at El Cajon Superior Court also reveal Alawadi’s 17-year-old daughter, Fatima Alhimidi, who called 911 to report the attack, was distraught over her pending arranged marriage to a cousin. A search of Fatima’s cellphone records shows that while she was being interviewed by investigators hours after the attack, someone sent the teen a text message that read, “The detective will find out tell them (can’t) talk,” the affidavit states. Fatima and her mother were the only ones at their El Cajon home on Skyview Street when the attack occurred about 11 a.m. on March 21. Alawadi’s husband, Kassim Alhimidi, had reportedly left to take the couple’s other younger children to school, although police state in the March 27 affidavit that his whereabouts had not yet been confirmed. Fatima told El Cajon police that she heard her mother squeal, and 10 seconds later heard the sound of glass breaking, the affidavit said. She told police she thought her mother had dropped a plate. Ten minutes later, the daughter discovered her mother lying unconscious on the ground, near a computer, and called 911.\n\nShe heard her mother squeal? Before we heard that she slept through the whole thing.\n\nA neighbor reported seeing a skinny dark-skinned male running west from the area of Alawadi’s house. He was described as being in his late teens to early 20s, 5 feet 7 inches tall, 150 pounds, wearing a dark blue or black hooded sweatshirt and carrying a brown doughnut-shaped cardboard box. Alawadi died at a hospital three days later. An autopsy noted the assault was “extremely violent” and showed Alawadi had at least six hits to the head, with at least four skull fractures. The injuries were possibly caused by an object similar to a tire iron, with a striking edge that is narrow and made of a hard material, according to the records. The sheriff’s crime lab determined a threatening handwritten note found near the victim was a copy, not the original, the records state. Authorities have not made public the contents of the note, but Fatima and other family members have told reporters that it ordered the family to go back where they came from. Police have said that the note indicates the possibility of a hate crime but have stressed they are exploring all possibilities. The family told police a similar note was left at their home in the weeks before the attack, but the family did not keep the note or report it to police at the time. The possibility of a hate crime has reverberated around the world, especially in the Muslim community, and prompted supporters to hold candlelight vigils and demonstrations denouncing bigotry….\n\nApologies awaited. Neither Pamela Geller nor I have ever condoned or advocated violence, or anything but legal action in defense of human rights. These Islamic supremacist groups and their Leftist allies are avid to destroy our reputations and find a “hate crime” they can connect us with, so as to silence the truths we tell.\n\nDuring a search of the home and the couple’s vehicles in the hours after the attack, police found court paperwork to file for divorce in Alawadi’s Ford Explorer. The packet was not filled out, but a form requesting a court fee waiver was filled out in handwriting with Alawadi’s name, address and phone number…. Police also searched computers, cellphones and other devices. Among the evidence they were searching for was an earring matching a bloody one found near Alawadi. Family told investigators that she usually wore four earrings, according to the records. Detectives were also seeking any other notes, a weapon similar to a tire iron and any forensic evidence. Investigators also learned of a previous police contact with Fatima. On Nov. 3, police found Fatima with a 21-year-old man after responding to a report of two people possibly having sex in a car, the documents state. Officers called her mother, who came to the location and picked up the girl. As they were driving away, Fatima said, “I love you, mom,” before jumping out of the vehicle onto Mollison Avenue at 35 mph. She was taken to a hospital with several injuries, including a possible broken arm. She refused to talk to police at the hospital but reportedly told paramedics and hospital staff that she was being forced to marry her cousin and didn’t want to. Rawnaq Yacub, the man in the incident, told U-T San Diego Wednesday that police interviewed him after the slaying and some of his clothes were taken from the home he shares with his family. He said he has no connection to the crime. He described Fatima as a “best friend” and said there is no romantic relationship. He and Fatima were only talking in the car when police contacted them five months ago, he said. Fatima, her father and a brother flew to Iraq last week for Alawadi’s funeral on Saturday and planned to stay for two weeks, a family friend said. Alawadi’s father is a Shia cleric in Iraq.\n\nWhat do you bet they don’t return?"

Last summer, protestors in Balcombe used a makeshift camp as a base to demonstrate against Cuadrilla’s drilling, while local residents, advised by the larger environmental groups, created legal and regulatory obstacles for the company.\n\nCuadrilla’s permit has run out at Balcombe, but activists have set up a camp, complete with a wind turbine for electricity, outside a site in Barton, near Manchester, where another company called IGas Energy is preparing to drill.\n\nOn Sunday, protesters tried to dislodge the gates to the site, but the company reinforced them with an earth-moving machine, said Rachel Thompson, a local resident affiliated with a protest group called Frack Off.\n\n“This is going to grow and grow.

But trouble flared again on Saturday. Video provided by Chevron shows young men flattening a security fence and tossing rocks onto the site.\n\nMaria Olteanu, an activist in Bucharest, the capital, who acts as a liaison with people in Pungesti, says the villagers there are “fighting for their lives. They are sure there will be water and soil contamination. Animals will die,” as a result of fracking, she said.\n\nShe also said people in remote areas are now knowledgeable about the well-publicized problems like water pollution that opponents say fracking has caused in the United States.\n\n“We are very well-connected with a European network and international network,” she said.\n\nAlthough the situation varies from country to country, fracking’s opponents are scoring successes. In countries like Germany and France, fracking is forbidden. Even in Britain, where the national government favors shale gas exploitation, it has been more than two years since a company fracked a shale gas well.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, national governments like those in Romania, Poland and Ukraine have given their assent, but some people in local communities have yet to be won over. There has even been resistance in Poland, although a poll last summer showed strong overall support for shale gas production. In the village of Zurawlow in southeast Poland, near the Ukrainian border, farmers have blocked access to a Chevron test site with farm equipment for several months.\n\nTomasz Szpryngier, an investor in tourism projects whose family owns farmland in the area, said by telephone “if this area starts to be an exploitation area, it will be like putting money in a ditch.”\n\nAlthough Chevron says the protesters have not had a “significant impact” on its operations, the company has filed a civil action against them for “violating Chevron’s rights to access its property and conduct scheduled works.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDavid L. Goldwyn, a former senior energy official at the U.S. Department of State, who has run workshops on shale gas for regulators, lawmakers and academics in eastern Europe with Chevron sponsorship, says companies are finding themselves in a difficult situation.\n\n“While they are still negotiating for licenses, the NGOs spin up local opposition,” he said, referring to nongovernmental organizations. “Before they have boots on the ground, protests are underway.”\n\nMr. Goldwyn thinks that if shale gas exploitation is to win acceptance, governments “are going to have to be a little more creative about how they are going to share the income.”\n\nUnlike the United States, in most countries the state owns the mineral resources, and local residents often see drilling as more of a nuisance than a potential benefit."

         "The individualistic countries tend to put rights and privacy first. People in these societies tend to overvalue their own skills and overestimate their own importance to any group effort. People in collective societies tend to value harmony and duty. They tend to underestimate their own skills and are more self-effacing when describing their contributions to group efforts.\n\nResearchers argue about why certain cultures have become more individualistic than others. Some say that Western cultures draw their values from ancient Greece , with its emphasis on individual heroism, while other cultures draw on more on tribal philosophies. Recently, some scientists have theorized that it all goes back to microbes. Collectivist societies tend to pop up in parts of the world, especially around the equator, with plenty of disease-causing microbes. In such an environment, you’d want to shun outsiders, who might bring strange diseases, and enforce a certain conformity over eating rituals and social behavior.\n\nPhoto\n\nEither way, individualistic societies have tended to do better economically. We in the West have a narrative that involves the development of individual reason and conscience during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and then the subsequent flourishing of capitalism. According to this narrative, societies get more individualistic as they develop.\n\nBut what happens if collectivist societies snap out of their economic stagnation? What happens if collectivist societies, especially those in Asia , rise economically and come to rival the West? A new sort of global conversation develops.\n\nThe opening ceremony in Beijing was a statement in that conversation. It was part of China’s assertion that development doesn’t come only through Western, liberal means, but also through Eastern and collective ones.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We’ve seen displays of mass conformity before, but this was collectivism of the present — a high-tech vision of the harmonious society performed in the context of China’s miraculous growth.\n\nIf Asia’s success reopens the debate between individualism and collectivism (which seemed closed after the cold war), then it’s unlikely that the forces of individualism will sweep the field or even gain an edge.\n\nFor one thing, there are relatively few individualistic societies on earth. For another, the essence of a lot of the latest scientific research is that the Western idea of individual choice is an illusion and the Chinese are right to put first emphasis on social contexts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nScientists have delighted to show that so-called rational choice is shaped by a whole range of subconscious influences, like emotional contagions and priming effects (people who think of a professor before taking a test do better than people who think of a criminal). Meanwhile, human brains turn out to be extremely permeable (they naturally mimic the neural firings of people around them). Relationships are the key to happiness. People who live in the densest social networks tend to flourish, while people who live with few social bonds are much more prone to depression and suicide .\n\nThe rise of China isn’t only an economic event. It’s a cultural one. The ideal of a harmonious collective may turn out to be as attractive as the ideal of the American Dream.\n\nIt’s certainly a useful ideology for aspiring autocrats."

Conservatives, for example, have stronger disgust reactions than liberals, and some early brain-scan data hints that the two groups process risk and fear differently.\n\nThe latest discovery: Conservatives and liberals actually smell different!\n\nA recent experiment found that conservatives like the smell of other conservatives, while liberals find the smell of conservatives repugnant.\n\nStephanie Pappas reports for Live Science, Sept. 22, 2014, that a new study finds that people prefer the scents of those who share their political attitudes. This small, subconscious preference could explain why people gravitate toward mates whose politics mesh with theirs — perhaps compatibility has a smell.\n\nAdvertisements"

         "“But these laws were being made long before I was governor, and no new ones have been made since I’ve been governor.”\n\nIn fact, Mr. Christie vetoed a gun bill in August that had been supported by the judiciary and many law enforcement officials, and unanimously passed in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature. It would add an extra check when people with a history of mental illness seek legal permission to buy and own firearms. An investigation by The New York Times in 2011 found that many states had opened up new avenues for people with significant mental health problems to have their histories expunged, and thus acquire guns. Mr. Christie said the proposed law would only confuse matters in “an already cumbersome area of the law.”\n\nThe State Senate voted to override Mr. Christie’s veto of the bill — the first time that has happened on any veto since he took office in January 2010 — but on Thursday, the bill’s sponsor in the Assembly, a Democrat, decided to postpone a vote because he could not get enough Republicans to buck the governor. Even the Republican co-sponsor of the bill was unwilling to stand up for it against the Christie veto.\n\nSo it’s not just thoughts and prayers; it’s vetoes, too, and campaign boasts about blocking new laws.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The school now has bulletproof walls, double deadbolt locks, metal frames on doors, and surveillance cameras everywhere.\n\nAnother business opportunity was identified by a company in Oklahoma, which marketed bulletproof blankets to schools so that children could huddle under them during “active shootings.” They apparently would work as long as the assailant was not using high-velocity guns.\n\nAnd of course, there is getting rid of the Confederate battle flag, which was the response to the killing of nine people in a black church in Charleston, S.C. You remember Charleston, right? That was not quite six months ago, June 17.\n\nAs a statement of revulsion, the South Carolina Legislature ordered the removal of the Confederate flag from the state capital, an event that took place on July 10.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the 144 days since then, 169 mass shootings have taken place across the country, according to data on shootingtracker.com.\n\nThe land of the free and the brave, and the home of the futile gesture.\n\n“I am pretty sure we U.S. citizens threw out reason along with the baby and the bathwater when we decided that protecting kids with bulletproof gym mats” was the solution, Cordelia Newlin de Rojas wrote on the blog BluntMoms. Social media was mere posturing, she wrote: “Our computer screens are as effective as the bulletproof gym mats.”\n\nThoughts and prayers may be necessary, but they are demonstrably not sufficient, even for those who believe.\n\nAnd for those who don’t, such as the New York actor and raconteur Malachy McCourt, hearing yet another invocation of “thoughts and prayers” can inspire acid responses. As Mr. McCourt wrote on Facebook: “The prayers will bend the barrels of the guns so that they are pointing at the assailants rather than the intended victim.”"

         "Last July, Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. spoke eloquently of “the importance of the constitutionally protected news gathering process,” the essential role of a free press when it comes to “government accountability and an open society,” and the need to better protect journalists from federal leak investigations.\n\nAt the time, he described policy revisions that supposedly would achieve those goals, including enhanced oversight by senior Justice Department officials and a new presumption that news organizations would be notified when the government sought their records from phone companies, Internet providers and other third parties.\n\nNow, six months later, Mr. Holder says those policies are being followed, but he has yet to actually issue the new guidelines. And, most immediately, he has yet to call off the misguided quest by prosecutors to compel James Risen, a reporter for The Times, who wrote a 2006 book about the Central Intelligence Agency, to reveal a confidential source. Barely a week after Mr. Holder delivered his report to the White House, the Justice Department issued a statement declaring agreement with a chilling 2-to-1 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Virginia, denying the existence of any reporters’ privilege, grounded in the First Amendment, to protect confidential sources in criminal cases.\n\nThat has been the department’s position on the case from its start to Mr. Risen’s failed appeal in January to the full circuit court. It is sharply at odds with the nearly universal consensus among states that reporters have a common law privilege to protect confidential sources. It also runs counter to the finding by a federal district judge, Leonie Brinkema, and the dissenting appeals judge, Roger Gregory, that the government has ample evidence to proceed with the prosecution without making a reporter give up a source or go to jail. So much for Mr. Holder’s talk of respecting “constitutionally protected” news gathering and not threatening journalists with jail for doing their jobs, except in “extraordinary” circumstances.\n\nMr. Risen has asked the Supreme Court to review his case. But the best resolution would be for Mr. Holder to reconsider Mr. Risen’s subpoena, in keeping with the letter and spirit of his new guidelines. A group of media organizations, including The Times, has been urging just that.\n\nIt is too late to erase the damage stemming from the Risen case and other egregious attacks on a free press on Mr. Holder’s watch. But reducing the stain on Mr. Holder’s legacy, and building a better legacy, begins with dropping the demand that Mr. Risen testify about his sources."

         "Man sleeping (Shutterstock)\n\nSleep deprivation ranks among the most beloved torture methods of dictators, religious cults, Inquisition leaders and garden-variety sadists. Roughly two years ago, when the Senate Intelligence Committee released its report on the CIA’s “enhanced interrogation techniques”—the genteel expression for torture—it revealed that, along with waterboarding and rectal feeding, the agency has a soft spot for sleep deprivation.\n\nMost of us have not experienced the astounding cruelty of state-sanctioned torture, knock on wood, but we are familiar with the far less horrific experience of school- and job-related lack of sleep. Recent studies suggest that even this less extreme variety of sleep deprivation has real consequences, and some experts say, as a culture, we’re scheduling the day all wrong.\n\nAmong those voices is Paul Kelley, a neuroscientist and research associate at Oxford University’s Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute. Kelley believes work and school days generally begin too early and run counter to the natural circadian rhythms of adolescents and adults under the age of 55. He says all that lost sleep causes big problems that can ultimately pose “threats to health, mood performance and mental health.”\n\n“At the age of 10 you get up and go to school and it fits in with our nine-to-five lifestyle,” Kelley told attendees of last year’s British Science Festival, according to the Guardian. “When you are about 55 you also settle into the same pattern. But in between it changes a huge amount.”\n\nWhile we’ve been culturally conditioned to suck it up and get on with it, so to speak, the good doctor says you can’t simply override millions of years of evolution where sleep is concerned. For starters, “[y]our liver and your heart have different patterns and you’re asking them to shift two or three hours,” according to Kelley. “We cannot change our 24-hour rhythms. You cannot learn to get up at a certain time. Your body will be attuned to sunlight and you’re not conscious of it because it reports to hypothalamus, not sight.”\n\nInstead, he suggests, work days should start “around three hours later, which is entirely natural.” That sounds like a solution we can all get on board with; a sacrifice we should all be willing to make for the sake of science.\n\n“Staff should start at 10am,” Kelley says, according to Buzzfeed News. “You don’t get back to [a natural 9am schedule] starting point until 55. Staff are usually sleep-deprived. We’ve got a sleep-deprived society. It is hugely damaging on the body’s systems because you are affecting physical, emotional and performance systems in the body.”\n\n“This applies in the bigger picture to prisons and hospitals,” Kelley adds. “They wake up people and give people food they don’t want. You’re more biddable because you’re totally out of it. Sleep deprivation is a torture.”\n\nKelley also thinks school hours should be modified to better sync with the “internal clocks” of most students, and says the adjustment will allow their brains to follow. The scientist believes optimized learning for a 10-year-old would mean a school day that begins after 8:30am. For 16-year-olds, the day would start at 10am and college students would have their first class at 11am. The former head teacher of a middle school in his native England, Kelley shifted the days’ beginning from 8:30am to 10am, after which he says top grades increased by 19 percent. He posits that a similar time shift in other schools could help push up grades by 10 percent.\n\nTo test this idea, Kelley has launched a project called Teensleep along with neuroscientist and Oxford University colleague Russell Foster and Harvard Medical School professor Steven Lockley. The pilot project and study will compare how students fare in schools with traditional early start times versus those that begin at 10am.\n\nKelley isn’t the only one calling for schools to get things rolling later. As the Atlantic noted in a story last year, both the Centers for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended that schools schedule classes later in the morning so students can get the necessary sleep they need to make the most of the learning day. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has even said it might not be such a bad idea. An Atlantic-cited study from the University of Minnesota’s Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement seems to offer yet more support for letting kids get more sleep:\n\nResearchers analyzed data from more than 9,000 students at eight high schools in Minnesota, Colorado, and Wyoming and found that shifting the school day later in the morning resulted in a boost in attendance, test scores, and grades in math, English, science, and social studies. Schools also saw a decrease in tardiness, substance abuse, and symptoms of depression. Some even had a dramatic drop in teen car crashes.\n\nAs the CDC notes, 42 states report their public schools begin before 8:30am, while 40 percent of high schools around the country actually start before 8am. School days beginning that early might allow younger students to get the sleep they need, but studies show natural shifts in circadian rhythms result in older kids going to sleep later and later. Adolescents and teens aren’t lazy; their biology is changing a lot and sleep is part of that. Yet there remains fairly strong resistance to changing school hours, with opponents citing multiple reasons for keeping things the way they are. Some experts suggest that refusal to consider the benefits is just another symptom of our culture of overwork.\n\n“I get tired of the argument that these kids have to do all these activities and community service and therefore can’t start school later,” Kyla Wahlstrom, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Applied Research and Educational Improvement, told Scientific American. “The issue is not the start time. It’s that the students are overly busy. There is too much pressure to cram it all in just to have a good resume to get into college.”\n\nWhether or not you believe our work and school days should get off to a later start, one thing isn’t up for debate: most of us aren’t getting nearly enough sleep. In fact, a 2013 Gallup survey found a whopping 40 percent of American adults get less than the recommended allowance of seven to nine hours of sleep a night. The CDC cites insufficient sleep as a public health issue. And the UK’s National Health Service reports that one third of Brits don’t get the sleep they need. It is, Kelley puts it, a “huge society” problem, and pervasive cultural notions are hard to change.\n\n“This is an international issue,” Kelley laments. “Everybody is suffering and they don’t have to.”"

         "Every college basketball fan knows all too well how prevalent upsets can be during any given week of this cantankerous and infinitely enjoyable sport. But this week…it was a rough time for any program that had a number next to the name of their respective academic institutions. Not only did four of the top 10 teams in the country lose this week, but three of those four supposed top tier programs lost twice! Simply put, last week was a bombshell of utter chaos and confusion as many perennial National Title contenders sustained questionable losses and will have to rebound valiantly if they have any hope of garnering a favorable seed come March Madness. While the highly anticipated tournament is still roughly two months away, this is the time where the truly great programs need to separate themselves from the overconfident pretenders that will inevitably continue to drop down the rankings into the dreaded basement of irrelevancy.\n\n1. Villanova Wildcats\n\nWith an offense that both scores (87.9 PPG) and moves the basketball effectively (17.6 APG), the Wildcats have rarely been reliant on their average defense to help them overcome most of the opponents they have faced in the Big East. Although no team is safe at the top of the rankings, the Wildcats have been merciless when it comes to out scoring their opponents early and are not showing any signs of slowing down in that department.\n\n2. Virginia Cavaliers\n\nYou know that story. The Cavaliers are fantastic on defense and play well enough offensively to score aggressively in transition and underneath the basket in half-court situations. If the Cavaliers can take out the highly prolific Blue Devils this week, they will have emphatically proved that a top-ranked defense is more than enough to win consistently and to potentially go far in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n3. Purdue Boilermakers\n\nThe only bad thing you can say about the Boilermakers is that they have not played a ranked opponent since defeating Louisville earlier in the season (November 28th). With that being said, Purdue has done exactly what an elite program is supposed to do: they have almost always handily defeated the unranked opposition they have encountered. With Michigan coming into town for a revenge contest, the Boilermakers will get another opportunity to prove that they should rightfully be considered one of the best programs in the country.\n\n4. Duke Blue Devils\n\nDuring their last four games, the Duke Blue Devils have been playing well to fantastic defensively as they have held their opponents to 75 points or less during their four-game winning streak. Granted, these impressive defensive showings came against Pittsburgh twice, Wake Forest and Miami, but at least Duke has finally realized that if they can at least be average at preventing their opponents from scoring that they can be one of the best programs in the country down the stretch of the regular season.\n\n5. Xavier Musketeers\n\nOvercoming Seton Hall in their latest victory thanks to some impressive shooting late in the game, the Musketeers are once again vying for the top spot in the Big East. Although it would be wishful thinking for the top-ranked Wildcats to slip up anytime soon, the Musketeers have to be chomping at the bit to get revenge against the Wildcats when they face each other again on February 17th.\n\n6. Kansas Jayhawks\n\nAlthough a close call win over Baylor at home revealed some lingering issues with this programs inconsistency issues when scoring the basketball, their tenacity on the defensive end has been their saving grace in their last three wins. If the Jayhawks can get an impressive win over Oklahoma this week, they could create some much-desired separation between themselves and the rest of the Big 12.\n\n7. Michigan State Spartans\n\nAlthough it’s been a bumpy road for the Spartans in their last four games (2-2), there is not much doubt how great this team can be on offense and defense when they are firing on all cylinders (85.2 PPG, 63.7 PAPG). Considering they do not face a ranked opponent until February 10th (Purdue), the Spartans should be able to work out their inconsistency issues without suffering too much in terms of sustaining upset defeats.\n\n8. Cincinnati Bearcats\n\nAlthough the offense of the Bearcats has been anything but productive for the most part, they have actually stepped up impressively in three of their last four games (have scored 76 points or more in those affairs). Defensively, the Bearcats have been nothing short of terrific as they have not allowed an opponent to score more than 60 total points since December 21st against Cleveland State.\n\n9. North Carolina Tar Heels\n\nHolding three of their last four opponents to under 70 total points, the Tar Heels are beginning to establish themselves as something more than just a relentless shooting program. If the Tar Heels can consistently stifle opponents defensively while relentlessly shooting the ball at a high rate (82.7 PPG), they could quickly become one of the favorites to win it all by the end of the season.\n\n10. West Virginia Mountaineers\n\nDespite losing two of their last three games, the Mountaineers have remained true to their identity of playing dominant defense. However, their offense has come up short in their two recent losses to Kansas and Texas Tech, something that can be fixed fairly easily considering four of their five starters are currently averaging double-digit points per game.\n\n11. Arizona Wildcats\n\nDespite looking wildly inconsistent on offense and defense recently, the scrappy Wildcats have been able to play well enough on either side of the court to win tight games down the stretch. In order for the Wildcats to continue their winning ways, they will need their electric offense to step consistently if they hope to reach their potential of being considered National Title contenders (82.2 PPG).\n\n12. Gonzaga Bulldogs\n\nAgainst Saint Mary’s, the Bulldogs had a grand opportunity to assert themselves as a legitimately competitive program that could at least beat the one competitive opponent in their conference. Unfortunately for Gonzaga, they were unable to convert on enough possessions to beat a well-rounded Saint Mary’s team that will likely hold onto the top spot in the West Coast Conference until these two programs face off again in mid-February.\n\n13. Ohio State Buckeyes\n\nUndefeated in Big 10 Conference play (8-0), the surprising and highly competitive Buckeyes have ground out several impressive victories thanks to their now elite defense (have held six of their last seven opponents to under 70 total points). Although they may not have the dominant athletes like some of the perceived elite programs in college basketball, they have enough reliable shooters to assist a defense that is finally starting to hit its stride.\n\n14. Auburn Tigers\n\nAside from a devastating loss to Alabama, the Tigers have been a program that has continued to persevere despite being hit particularly hard by the FBI probe that resulted with two of their best players being suspended indefinitely. If they can continue to play the glass this effectively while converting their extra opportunities into points (85.3 PPG, 72.4 PAPG), they could win the SEC outright by the end of the regular season.\n\n15. Arizona State Sun Devils\n\nWhile the Sun Devils are clearly trending downward, they have been the fortunate beneficiaries of some immense chaos above them while winning enough close games to keep themselves relevant in the Pac-12. Eventually, though, the Sun Devils will be in danger of dropping out of the rankings if their gifted sharpshooters continue to fail when it comes to carrying this exciting albeit one-dimensional offense.\n\n16. Oklahoma Sooners\n\nEven when superstar Trae Young scores 48 points in a game (see the loss to Oklahoma State), the Sooners still do not have what it takes to win against lesser opponents. Turning over the ball at an alarming rate of 14 times per game (Young contributes over five turnovers per game) while allowing 81.6 PPG, the Sooners are finally being punished for playing too loose with the basketball and are coming to the realization that you need more than an electric offense to win in a sport that is rife with parity and worthy competitors.\n\n17. Texas Tech Red Raiders\n\nWithout question, it was a tough week for some of the top-ranked teams in the Big 12. However, the Red Raiders arguably suffered the most as they have lost three of their last four games, with their last two losses coming against opponents that are currently in the basement of the Big 12 standings (Texas, Iowa State). While their defense has played enough, it has been their progressively worsening offense that has done them in during this tough stretch (have not scored more than 75 in their last five games).\n\n18. Wichita State Shockers\n\nOne of several top-ranked programs to lose twice last week, the once fearlessly competitive Shockers dropped back-t0-back games to unranked opponents for the first time since November 2015. While the Shockers have the prolific offense to bounce back, their lack of effort on the defensive end recently has to be rectified if they hope to reclaim the moniker of being one of the top programs in college basketball.\n\n19. Saint Mary’s Gaels\n\nWith a thrilling win against their hated rivals in the Gonzaga Bulldogs on the road, the Gaels have firmly taken hold of the top spot in the West Coast Conference and will likely hold onto that coveted spot for the remainder of the season. Effective on both offense and defense (80.1 PPG, 65.9 PAPG), the Gaels have the discipline and personnel to become a dark horse program once the NCAA Tournament commences.\n\n20. Tennessee Volunteers\n\nWith a 4-3 record in the SEC, the Volunteers are doing just enough to keep themselves near the top of their conference standings. Although their finicky offense is a serious concern (77.7 PPG), the Volunteers have been able to overcome their noticeable deficiencies by playing strong defense down the stretch of close games.\n\n21. Clemson Tigers\n\nWhile the unlikely success story of the Tigers has begun to become less majestic and intriguing in their last four games (2-2), they have nevertheless remained committed to grinding out tough victorious with an opportunistic defense that prides itself on preventing their opponents from making easy shots (six BPG). It may not always be pretty, but the Tigers have an established identity that has proven to be effective more often than not.\n\n22. Michigan Wolverines\n\nAlthough Michigan’s anemic offense looked particularly dreadful in a 72-52 loss to Nebraska last week, the physically imposing Wolverines were able to overcome this brutal defeat by winning their other two games last week against both Maryland and Rutgers. While the Wolverines have to establish some type of continuity as a shooting team if they hope to remain in the conversation as a Big 10 title contender (74.5 PPG), their relentless defense should be able to carry them until they can establish a more dynamic and competitive presence offensively (62.5 PAPG).\n\n23. Kansas State Wildcats\n\nAlthough the Wildcats are not particularly dominant on either offense or defense, they are a team that knows how to play the big boys of their conference extremely tough (won two of their last three games, all contests were against ranked opponents). If this team can continue to be tenacious when it comes to forcing turnovers (eight SPG) they could find themselves being one of the top dogs in the incredibly competitive and deep Big 12 Conference.\n\n24. Creighton Blue Jays\n\nConsidering how this season has transpired for the Blue Jays thus far, this program should have a place reserved in spots 23-25 of the rankings every other week. Just when it appears that the Blue Jays are going cold shooting wise and lack a sufficient defense to be competitive, they somehow manage to rally and pull off an impressive win over a conference opponent. With the Blue Jays facing the deadly Wildcats in a couple of weeks, it becomes fair to wonder if this team has the potential to become a sleeper contender if they can play great basketball consistently.\n\n25. Rhode Island Rams\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, the defensively scrappy Rams have been flirting with a spot in the top-25 and have sneaked their way in the rankings this week due to the immense amount of chaos above them. Currently riding a 10 game winning streak, the Rams may have just enough going for them defensively to remain highly competitive in the A-10 Conference (66.7 PAPG).\n\nVIEW GALLERY"

         "Just Because It’s Easier to Steal – Doesn’t Mean It Isn’t Stealing\n\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\n\n(Before It's News)\n\nBack when I was a musician – writing songs rather than things like this – I was just about the only one I knew who wasn’t stealing music via the heist website Napster. And I lived in Austin, Texas – the “Live Music Capital of the World.” I knew a LOT of musicians.\n\nNapster was “originally founded as a pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing Internet service that emphasized sharing audio files, typically music, encoded in MP3 format. The original company ran into legal difficulties over copyright infringement….”\n\nTranslation: People downloaded music – for which they never paid. Hence the “legal difficulties over copyright infringement.” Napster was a monster music shopping mall – without the shopping.\n\nThe arguments in defense of this theft were (and remain) patently (no pun intended) absurd. Some of the absurdest:\n\n“The musicians make money from touring – we’re only stealing from the record companies.”\n\nA microcosm of the Democrats’ “Tax the evil rich to pay for free stuff for you” mantra. Which is obnoxious. Stealing from anyone – is stealing. Oh – and of course musicians get paid for their music. Unless their music is stolen.\n\n“I’m not stealing anything physical. It’s not like I’m taking a compact disc. So they’re not out anything.”\n\nBehold the absolutely ridiculous “Intellectual property isn’t property” assertion. Even many center-right and libertarian people and outfits – some of some stature – lamely put this forward.\n\nBut a compact disc – bereft of Adele, Drake or Taylor Swift – is nothing more than high-tech plastic. You’re not stealing it to get the high-tech plastic – you want what’s encoded thereon.\n\nIt’s the musical ideas – which beget the music, the recording, the marketing and the teenage madness – that matter. These ideas – are intellectual property.\n\nThus is intellectual property, in fact, MORE important than physical property – not less. And it always has been.\n\nTechnological advances don’t change any of this. New platforms – same principles. Stealing vinyl records – was wrong. So too was stealing 8-track tapes. And cassettes. And CDs. Stealing MP3s – is stealing.\n\nNapster was only a toe-in-the-water beginning. The theft of digital goods – music, movies, computer software,… – has only exponentially grown. Into a HUGE global problem. (And that is not just a Kim Dotcom pun.) See also: China. And….\n\nOf course there is always a constituency for free stuff (see, again: The Democrat Party). Some major players have in fact made it a key component of their business model (Hello, Google). These intellectual property thieves have lots of coin (because they rarely pay for anything) – so they can dress up their thievery quite nicely.\n\nThey can hire lots of lawyers and organizations to pretend that opposition to their thievery – is actually opposition to technological advancement. (When it, of course, defunds and undermines future technological advancement. If you can’t get paid for your last advancement – why on Earth would you or anyone else invest in your next?)\n\nAnd these thieves can hire lots of lobbyists – to have law written that all-but-legalizes their theft. To wit: The Innovation and Patent Acts currently under consideration in Congress. Bills which would make it so much easier for people to do to patents – what thieves like Napster, China and Kim Dotcom do to copyrights (and trademarks). It would become dramatically more difficult for intellectual property holders – whose property protection device is patents – to stop the people who are stealing their ideas.\n\nThese bills are anti-intellectual property. And anti-property. And anti-technological advancement. And anti-capitalism. What they are – is pro-theft. It makes a lot of illegal thievery – a lot less subject to the law and its enforcement.\n\nI understand why the thieves would want this. I have zero idea why anyone else does.\n\nThe post Just Because It’s Easier to Steal – Doesn’t Mean It Isn’t Stealing appeared first on RedState.\n\nSource: http://www.redstate.com/diary/setonmotley/2015/12/15/just-easier-steal-doesnt-mean-isnt-stealing/"

         "Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks during an interview for Reuters at his office in Washington, U.S., July 10, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nThe Trump administration took a big step Tuesday towards repealing former President Barack Obama’s restrictions on opening a gold mine in Alaska.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a proposal to nix Obama’s plan to block the Pebble Mine to protect the state’s water quality and the area’s salmon population. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt wants to give developers time to request mining permits from the Army Corps of Engineers without being blocked.\n\n“A withdrawal of the proposed determination would remove any uncertainty, real or perceived, about [the developer’s] ability to submit a permit application and have that permit application reviewed,” the proposal noted.\n\nObama’s decision turned the mine into a political football. Environmentalists rallied around the blockage and Republicans railed against the move because they feared the president was overstepping his authority.\n\nActivists believed that the mine would pollute streams running into nearby Bristol Bay, Alaska — the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery. Obama’s EPA agreed and worked to block the mine.\n\nThe EPA prevented the Pebble Mine from even applying for a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit after the urging of environmental groups and some Alaskan tribes, some of which were wary of more development in Bristol Bay.\n\nAn agency report in 2014 signaled to investors that the project had a slim chance at acquiring a federal permit. Mining company Rio Tinto pulled out of the project shortly after the EPA’s report was issued. Other companies shortly followed suit.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology launched investigations into Obama’s decision and found that EPA ecologist Phil North worked with mine opponents to block Pebble Mine from being built.\n\nPruitt’s plan will be published in the Federal Register shortly, kicking off a three-month period for activists and shareholders to submit comments about the proposal. Obama initially blocked the mine in 2014.\n\nFollow Chris White on Facebook and Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

         "These pictures I believe surfaced on the web about 5 or so years ago. They certainly look good. There has been critics of this material.\n\n\n\nPersonally I think it is legit for the following reasons, first the old USSR would have been a natural' place of interest for aliens. Two the USSR was a military society and the military would have controlled any encounter with ufos. Three, surprisingly in many ways people find Russia to be more open today than the US is especially in subject areas concerning the paranormal which includes ufology. Lastly, the pictures are quite good and not recent and frankly difficult if not very expensive to fake unlike many ufo photos we have seen. The only other so called big faking was the Santilli videos which are being seen a credible again by many people."

         "when julia geist was asked to draw a picture of a computer scientist last year, the <NUM>-year-old sketched a businessman wearing glasses and a tie. looking around at her classmates’ drawings, she saw similar depictions of men. now, ms. geist said, “i see a computer scientist could be anyone” — including herself. her new perspective is a victory for girls who code. as part of an eight-week program with the manhattan-based nonprofit group, ms. geist and <NUM> other high school girls learned software programming, public speaking, product development and other skills to prepare them for jobs in the technology industry. girls who code is among the recent crop of programs intended to close the gender gap in tech by intervening early, when young women are deciding what they want to study. with names like hackbright academy, girl develop it, black girls code and girls teaching girls to code, these groups try to present a more exciting image of computer science. the paucity of women in the tech industry has been well documented. even though women represent more than half the overall work force, they hold less than a quarter of computing and technical jobs, according to the national center for women and information technology based at the university of colorado, boulder. at the executive and founder levels, women are even scarcer. a variety of advocacy and networking groups have tried to address the problem by coaching women on building start-ups, raising venture capital and climbing the management ranks at big companies. most recently, sheryl sandberg, the chief operating officer of facebook, published a best-selling book, “lean in,” that was a call to arms for women to pursue their ambition in the workplace. even so, the number of women entering technology has been declining. women earn just <NUM> percent of computer science degrees, down from <NUM> percent in <NUM>. tech executives, recruiters and financiers say women simply do not walk through their doors seeking work. “we actively recruit women, but there’s just not that many women who want to do this kind of work and are equipped to do the work from their education,” said adam messinger, the chief technology officer at twitter, who is on the board of girls who code. so the industry is trying a new approach. it is tackling the problem long before women start their careers, by teaching girls the basic skill of writing code. “we have to get women on the right side of the computer,” said margit wennmachers, a partner at andreessen horowitz, a venture capital firm in silicon valley. knowing a programming language is becoming essential not just for engineers, she added, but also for women who want to be tech executives or deal-makers or pursue other careers, from medicine to fashion. “the dividing line is learning to code,” ms. wennmachers said. “you either tell the computer what to do and you’ve got lots of great career options. or the computer tells you what to do and you end up working in a shoe store.” groups like girls who code are part of a national movement to recruit young people to software development and remain competitive with other economies. a new group, <URL>, for example, has people like mark zuckerberg of facebook and bill gates of microsoft pushing for all schools to teach children to code. but the need is most urgent for girls, said reshma saujani, who founded girls who code last year. roughly <NUM> percent of girls in middle school express an interest in engineering, science and math, she said. but by the time they get to college, just <NUM>.<NUM> percent choose computer science as a major. ms. saujani, the daughter of two engineers who were refugees from uganda, developed the idea while she was running for congress, a race that she lost. as she traveled from school to school on the campaign trail, she said she saw the same thing over and over: computer science classrooms without a single girl. “i saw the ability of technology to either enhance poverty or reduce it, and i saw girls not getting the same opportunities boys were,” said ms. saujani, who is now campaigning for public advocate in new york city. “back in the ’<NUM>s, you didn’t have gender parity in law or medicine, but something happened and women started opting into these professions. we have to do that in computer science.” researchers say many factors contribute to girls’ reluctance to pursue computing as early as elementary school, including discouraging parents, inadequate resources for teachers and a lack of exposure. studies have shown that girls imagine computer scientists as men working alone in a basement and can’t relate. it’s a significant disconnect, given how women embrace technology. female consumers make up a majority of users for many tech products. for technology companies, women also offer a diverse perspective, which can help bolster the bottom line."

         "disclaimer. this is general information on a law topic. nothing in this diary constitutes legal advice and it is not to be acted upon as legal advice. if you need advice, get it from a skilled professional. . john drake carries cash as part of his atm service business and he would also like to carry a handgun. finley fenton is a reserve sheriff's deputy who wants to carry a gun for self-protection while he is off duty. other individual plaintiff/applicants were also denied permits. two gun advocacy groups are also named plaintiffs - the association of new jersey rifle and pistol clubs and the second amendment foundation. the defendants are new jersey officials who refused the permit applications and two superior court judges who upheld those decisions. seven more gun advocacy groups, most of whom have routinely filed in recent carry cases, filed amicus \"friend of the court\" briefs supporting the plaintiffs. new jersey law. new jersey is a \"may issue\" state, one of about a dozen whose officials grant or deny gun carry permits under a broad standard such as a showing of need or good cause. (unlike <NUM> states, new jersey's constitution does not have a version of the second amendment. a majority of states have \"shall issue\" laws which require officials to grant a carry permit if certain statutorily specified conditions are met, such as demonstrations of safety awareness and maybe a background check. a few states have no permit requirements at all.) title <NUM>: chapter <NUM>-<NUM>.<NUM> criteria for the issuance of a permit to carry a handgun. (a) no application for a permit to carry a handgun shall be approved by a police chief of a municipality, the superintendent or the superior court, unless the applicant: <NUM>. is a person of good character who is not subject to any of the disabilities ... as provided in this chapter; <NUM>. has demonstrated that at the time of the application for the permit he or she is thoroughly familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns; and <NUM>. has demonstrated a justifiable need to carry a handgun. (italics added) plaintiff/applicants say the case presents two second amendment issues: (<NUM>) is there a constitutional right to carry a handgun outside one's home for self-defense? (<NUM>) can the state of new jersey require those who seek a permit to carry a handgun to prove a justifiable need? plaintiffs argue that because new jersey carry permits must be renewed every two years and officials grant only about <NUM> carry permits in that two-year period, the law is tantamount to no public carry rights at all. plaintiffs' lawyer is alan gura, a well-known second amendment specialist who successfully argued the heller and mcdonald cases at the supreme court. gura has been quoted in the new jersey herald as saying, \"drake is about a state thumbing its nose at supreme court decisions that said the second amendment is about carrying in case of confrontation.” he added: “this is about the supreme court enforcing what they have already pronounced.” i respect mr. gura's arguments in the courtroom, but that statement to a reporter is hyperbole. in the heller and mcdonald cases, the supreme court explicitly limited its rulings to a handgun for self-defense in one's home, and that has been the settled law for almost six years. and new jersey's judges and public officials have shown no disrespect at all for the us supreme court in their rulings against drake and the other applicants. the issue and argument of defendants. new jersey allows public carry, albeit that it severely restricts it. it contends only the second question is before the court - the justifiable need aspect - and that is a question settled by new jersey's long-standing policy to restrict for public safety reasons public carry of firearms in civilian hands. as the third circuit court of appeals stated: it is new jersey’s judgment that when an individual carries a handgun in public for his or her own defense, he or she necessarily exposes members of the community to a somewhat heightened risk that they will be injured by that handgun. new jersey has decided that this somewhat heightened risk to the public may be outweighed by the potential safety benefit to an individual with a “justifiable need” to carry a handgun. furthermore, new jersey has decided that it can best determine when the individual benefit outweighs the increased risk to the community through careful case-by-case scrutiny of each application, by the police and a court. the opinions of the district court and court of appeals can be found as appendices to drake's petition for certiorari the nra's view. in its amicus filing, the nra claims the first question totally resolves the case - that carry being a constitutional right, the state can't require any showing of need. such an absolutist view would go farther even than the heller case where the supreme court allowed room for a host of \"presumptively lawful regulatory measures.\" drake's petition for certiorari. this is a request to bring the record from the court below to scotus. \"cert\" is granted if four of the nine supreme court justices vote for it in conference. if granted, briefs would be filed on the merits over the next several months and oral arguments would be scheduled for next fall. more than <NUM> cert requests are made during each nine month term but the court grants argument for only about <NUM> cases. with only the rarest exceptions, no justice publicly discusses why the court did or didn't choose to hear a case. what considerations bear on granting cert? typically, the most compelling is that lower federal courts (and perhaps state courts, too) are divided, as they certainly are on the carry issue. nevertheless, scotus declined to take three cases on public carry within the last year: (<NUM>) kachalsky v. cacace challenging new york's \"proper cause\" standard. (<NUM>) woollard v. gallagher, a challenge to maryland's permit law that requires a \"good and substantial reason\"; and (<NUM>) nra v. mccraw from texas, which also raised the issue whether the state could properly bar <NUM>-<NUM> year olds from buying a gun. the argument against \"may issue\" in kachalsky and woollard, as it is in drake, was that the strict administration of the requirement for cause is equivalent to granting virtually no permits at all. there are other issues as well - how demanding the standard should be for judging \"may issue\" laws, for example - but the threshold question is whether there is a second amendment right to carry in the first place. other cases coming. is scotus's past pattern of not accepting carry cases necessarily a prologue? other carry cases are coming through the federal court pipeline. possibly these have a bearing on what - and when - the supreme court will act on drake. next to come for review is likely to be peruta v. county of san diego. california law allows each city and county to interpret the state's \"good cause\" standard for issuing concealed carry permits as it chooses. san diego county took a restrictive approach, requiring elaborate documentation and the showing of \"a set of circumstances that distinguish the applicant from the mainstream and causes him or her to be placed in harm's way.\" edward peruta (who lives in california part of the year) and several other applicants could not show any specific threats against them. the county sheriff concluded they did not qualify for carry permits. the federal district court held in peruta that heller does not stand for the broad proposition that all concealed weapon bans are presumptively constitutional. the next question, as it is in cases where the constitutionality of a statute is at issue, is the level of scrutiny to apply - how strict are the standards a court should use to decide if the statute complies with the constitution. scotus explicitly left this undecided in heller.) the district court applied intermediate scrutiny, finding that the county's policy favoring public safety and reducing the rate of gun use in crime was \"reasonably related to a 'significant,' 'substantial,' or 'important' governmental interest. moreover: the government also has an important interest in reducing the number of concealed handguns in public because of their disproportionate involvement in life-threatening crimes of violence, particularly in streets and other public places. the ninth circuit reversed, holding (<NUM>-<NUM>) that to \"bear arms\" meant to carry them and that scotus's heller decision pointed in favor of allowing carry for the purpose of confrontational self-defense. the court declared that a constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in public was so strong that the county's application of \"good cause\" was too restrictive no matter what level of scrutiny applied. the decision was by a three panel, as is the case with almost all federal appellate court decisions. however, a losing party can ask the full court to hear the case en banc. (the ninth circuit court of appeals has <NUM> judges, <NUM> of whom have senior status and a reduced workload, if any, so <NUM> are available. i understand the practice in the ninth circuit to be that it <NUM> judges would hear an en banc reargument, although it rarely grants one.) matters got complicated when san diego county announced it would not appeal and planned to start issuing carry permits when the decision became final. that prompted california attorney general kamala harris to petition for en banc review. the state of california had not been a party to the case, so it asked to intervene as did the brady campaign to prevent gun violence and - jointly - the california police chiefs association and the california peace officers association. as of may <NUM>, the requests to intervene and for en banc reconsideration remain pending. it took three years (!) for the peruta case to get from the us district court's decision to that three-judge ninth circuit decision. there is no particular reason to think the ninth circuit will act swiftly. observations. an interesting facet of drake's case is that unlike most states, new jersey statutes do not seem to distinguish between carrying a firearm openly or concealed. attorney gura argues that this makes his case a better one for scotus to decide: nor does it involve any difficult questions as to time, place or manner restrictions on the carrying of handguns. because new jersey’s law operates without distinction between the concealed and open carrying of handguns, confusing questions as to the manner in which petitioners might exercise their rights are avoided. whether drake is a purer, less confusing case is debatable. nj courts have discretion to impose the types of conditions that the applicants argue are not present in this case. so, john drake's case is in waiting. speculation abounds on why it was relisted for a third time. after all, this current supreme court seems quite willing to accept controversial issues. are some justices deterred by the strong presence of diverse \"states' rights\" policies on firearms matters? even after almost six years since heller, is scotus still reluctant to enter into its next second amendment ruling? are the justices awaiting another case, possibly peruta? is one of the majority justices in heller waffling, making the others worried about the outcome of the next gun rights case? all this, of course, is completely speculative. to be continued ... we are beginning a firearms law and policy newswire service covering gun law and policy news from all over the country. these reports will be as brief as a few sentences or as large as a full diary. they may include your home state perspective or simply report on current news. we shall overcome is the managing editor. we welcome your input. please feel free to post links with your comments and/or send a message to firearms law and policy. the daily kos firearms law and policy group studies actions for reducing firearm deaths and injuries in a manner that is consistent with the current supreme court interpretation of the second amendment. if you would like to write about firearms law please send us a kosmail. to see our list of original and republished diaries, go to the firearms law and policy diary list. click on the ♥ or the word \"follow\" next to our group name to add our posts to your stream, and use the link next to the heart to send a message to the group if you have a question or would like to join. breaking news. this morning, moments ago, scotus announced it denied cert in drake v. jerejian. the pro-carry folks will be bummed ... until the next case, probably peruta from the ninth circuit in california, comes up for consideration."
